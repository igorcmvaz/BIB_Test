	abstract = {This paper critically reviews the role of performance-based generative design in fast prototyping of buildings, describes the methodology of an automated generative layout design to produce complete building solutions, and presents a case study of multi-story buildings in urban context. The proposed approach evolves the building design solutions by interacting with the city 3D geometry and evaluates the energy consumption for air-conditioning. The building designs take into consideration urban geometric constraints and objectives, such as alignment with surrounding buildings, urban lot area, and relative and absolute position of the generated elements. During the evaluation process, the urban context is considered for casting shadows and reflecting solar radiation. The case study consists of six alternative 15-story buildings located in the city of São Paulo (Brazil), having commercial areas on the ground floor and two apartments per story on the remaining floors. The results show that, despite having similar apartments in every story, the urban context has a relevant impact on the buildings' energy performance. The difference between the apartments' best and worst energy performing stories ranges from 9% to 12% (ignoring the outlier story located in the first level), depending on the building solution. The results also show that the most energy efficient apartments’ story is not located in the top or bottom floors, but rather at an intermediate level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The evidence of climate change has increased the necessity for actions to avoid severe consequences for future generations. Recognising the benefits of sustainable and energy-efficient buildings has led to the development of several methods to estimate and rate the performance of building. Healthcare buildings are functional and dynamic structures that support their occupants’ healing processes and comfort. They have a significant role in society and specific goals in merging their strategic planning requirements (cost reduction, regulatory compliance, social responsibility, and performance improvement) with Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, this paper addresses critical issues regarding the sustainability of the Brazilian healthcare sector by analysing the suitability of the most common international healthcare building sustainability assessment methods to the specific social, economic, and environmental contexts of the Brazilian healthcare sector. The paper analyses the HBSAtool-PT, a sustainability assessment method developed for this type of building, and identifies the possibilities for adapting to the Brazilian context. As a result, this research proposes a framework to assess the sustainability of healthcare buildings in Brazil. In the framework’s definition, a survey was conducted to determine the opinion of building stakeholders regarding the importance of indicators. A weighing system for the proposed sustainability indicators was developed using the AHP method. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The social housing sector is playing an important role in Brazil, due to the necessity of its expansion. Currently, many residential projects perform poorly in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort. In addition, the impact of climate change on energy consumption may aggravate the energy scenario, increasing the dependence on the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. In parallel to this, there is a growing adoption of the Structural Concrete Insulated Panels (SCIP) and insulated concrete form (ICF) in the Brazilian construction industry, due to their advantages in reducing construction time, and cost. Therefore, this study provides a discussion on thermal-energy performance focusing on parametric analysis of the SCIP and ICF wall systems adoption for social housing in Brazil. Due to the fact that building performance is heavily affected by weather conditions, this study evaluated the computer simulation of the thermal-energy performance of SCIP and ICF wall systems for hot climates while addressing the impacts of climate change.

	abstract = {The energy sector affects many sectors such as industry and technology, buildings, services, agriculture, transportation, and logistics. With the development of technology and industrialization, the security of supply in energy and sustainable energy has become the most important agenda on a global scale. As the problems occurring in energy supply have a negative impact on energy demand, it causes economic crises globally. When the risks related to climate change caused by global warming are considered, the severity of the problem becomes clear. Possible risks in the future may lead to major economic disasters. Avoiding these risks is mainly possible with sustainable energy sources. Sustainable energy has two components: renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. In terms of sustainable development, one of the most important risks facing Turkey, which has experienced significant economic losses from climate changes, is its dependence on foreign energy sources. Like other countries, Turkey has also turned to renewable energy sources and policies to increase energy efficiency to eliminate this risk. Turkey's renewable energy sources mainly are solar, wind, geothermal, hydraulic, and biomass energy. Biomass energy is recognized as one of the sustainable energy sources. It is seen as an option that will contribute to socio-economic development and reduce foreign dependency on energy due to its benefits, such as creating employment in rural areas and preventing migration to the city. At this point, it is important to provide government aid and tax incentives for biomass energy production. his paper examines the current situation of tax incentives and aids provided to biomass energy as a sustainable energy source in Turkey, the USA, China, and Brazil, and recommendations are presented. © 2022 Peter Lang AG.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a cogeneration system to achieve the partial electric and thermal demands of a building in the public University. This proposed system comprises an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and equipment that will operate as a sink. For the latter, two types of equipment were selected: a cooling tower and an Absorption Refrigeration System (ARS). The building selected to propose the cogeneration system is the Institute of Sustainable Energies (IES), located at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), in the Northeast of Brazil. The performance of the system based on energetic and exergetic points of view operating under two distinct modes; ORC Simple (ORC-S) and ORC Combined (ORC-C), was compared. Both modes are based on the energy availability of the ICE exhaust gases. The thermodynamic models for both modes were developed based on the first and second laws of thermodynamic considering input parameters, such as inlet temperature, pressure ratio, and outlet temperature of the expander and the cold-water storage tank. For the exergoeconomic technique, the SPECO Method (Specific Exergy Costing) was used and implemented along with the Thermodynamic model. The ORC system studied uses a scroll expander and operates with R-134a as the working fluid and water/ammonia pair for the single-effect ARS. The results showed that the ORC-C mode can meet from 18.9% to 37.5% of the IES electricity demand, while the ORC-S mode can meet from 12.4% to 24.5%. The thermodynamic analysis reported that the ORC-C allowed a 33.6% increase in mechanical power production, an increase from approximately 4.5% to 34.5% in energy efficiency as well as exergy efficiencies around 40% and reduction of the total destroyed exergy. From the exergoeconomic point of view, the specific cost of the chilled water has a slight influence on the total cost of the products, while the specific cost of hot water has a strong influence on the total cost of the products (a variation of approximately 46% for a distinct heat source). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The use of shallow geothermal energy through energy piles for the air-conditioning of buildings is increasing worldwide. This type of renewable energy technology is still not utilized in Brazil, where the hot dominating weather regions and the air cooling demand predominate. In this case of unbalanced heat transfer to the ground, the efficiency of the system may decrease with time due to the excessive heat injection into the soil. In order to investigate the possibility of an efficient application of this technology in São Paulo city, a balanced use of the ground for a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) system utilizing energy piles is evaluated in the present paper. Energy foundations were designed to meet the balanced heating and cooling loads (air conditioning and water heating) of a hypothetical business hotel building located in a site at the campus of the University of São Paulo, where thermal response tests (TRTs) were conducted on different types of energy pile. The number of energy piles required to supply the building thermal loads were estimated using the pile heat exchanger modelling software PILESIM 2.1 and compared with an analytical model prediction. The evaluations were done for three different types of pile tested at the site chosen for this study: micropiles, steel pipe, and continuous flight auger (CFA) piles. The results indicate that the ground heat extraction should be considered for the use of GSHP systems with energy piles in air cooling-dominated scenarios similar to the case studied here. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Mecanica dos Solos.

However, specialists diverge about the accuracy of benchmarking models used to represent a location. The aim of this study is to compare two benchmarking models of nursery schools: first, considering the national building stock for Brazil; second, using local data for a Southern Brazilian city. The national benchmarking model was obtained from a country-level benchmarking policy. The local benchmarking model was developed in four steps: data collection, archetype modeling, energy simulations and multiple linear regression to formulate the benchmark equation. Then, both national and local models were compared using data of 12 actual nursery schools, through their energy performance classification and an ANOVA test. Results showed that there are no significant differences between the models. Conclusion points out that a country-level benchmarking can adequately represent a city-level benchmarking; however, a late clustering process might be indicated for cases in locations with particularities apart from the national building stock. This paper provides an opportunity to discuss if benchmarking models, created with large stock-level analysis, indeed can evaluate the energy performance of specific buildings. The authors recommend future research comprising other regions to enhance applicability of the results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In turn, Netzero energy buildings (NZEB) contribute to achieve SDG7 goals. This paper aims to identify which Brazilian higher education institutions (HEIs) practices contribute to developing the NZEB concept. Design/methodology/approach: Case studies were selected to identify which implanted practices applied by HEIs in Brazil, listed in the UI GreenMetric 2020 Ranking, are related to the NZEB concept. The implemented sustainable practices were also analyzed to evaluate the connections and impact between universities and the local community. Findings: Results show the lighting and air conditioning retrofit were among the most common practices related to energy efficiency to reduce consumption. For renewable energy generation, photovoltaic solar energy is the most common practice used by HEIs. Research limitations/implications: Only Brazilian HEIs listed in the UI Green Metric Ranking were analyzed. No standard regulation or formal reports support the wide dissemination of the strategies adopted by HEIs in Brazil. Practical implications: The strategies adopted by HEIs related to Netzero buildings can reduce emissions, optimize operating costs and improve building comfort conditions, which connect all SDGs. Social implications: HEIs can promote awareness related to energy use and clean energy generation within the local community. Originality/value: This paper presents the most common strategies adopted by Brazilian HEIs. However, limitations related to lack of strategies, data transparency and specific Netzero energy regulation were also found. These issues can hinder other HEIs to adopt similar strategies and contribute to the promotion of SDG7 in Brazil. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Straw is becoming a promising alternative insulation material to improve the building energy performance because of its low cost, large availability as cereal waste, its good hygrothermal properties, and its low embodied energy. The goal of this paper is to assess the hygrothermal performance of multi-layered straw walls with different boundary conditions. The study consists of evaluating five different straw-based wall assemblies, under a continental (Arkhangelsk, Russia), a tropical climate (Brasilia, Brazil), a temperate Mediterranean climate (Nice, France), and a cold desert climate Xinjiang (China). Numerical models of the heat and moisture transfer through the walls using WUFI software are developed, calibrated, and validated through experimental results from the literature. The chosen evaluation criteria are the total water content, the drying rate, the condensation risk, the mold growth, the moisture quantity, the time lag, and the decrement factor. Results show that straw walls with cement and/or wood covering can be used in tropical and temperate climates, coated straw walls with additional air layers in dry climates, while insulated straw walls are best fitted in continental climates. In the latter, the dryness rate varies between 7 and 40% with a low condensation risk of value in the range of 0–12%. It can be concluded that the straw wall's performance strongly depends on the interior and exterior added thermal insulation layers since they affect the ability of the material to dry out. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is an ongoing, global discussion on the ways to obtain Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). Nonetheless, little attention was given on the application of NZEBs in warm climates, especially in Brazil. Therefore, the aim of this article is to propose retrofit guidelines that meet a net zero energy target for four-story office buildings in the climactic conditions within Brasilia. Through this research 240 office buildings in the downtown area of the Brazilian capital were morphologically characterized, which served as the basis for the definition of a representative model of the four-story office buildings. The model variations – 69 in total – were tested taking in consideration a combination of building skin variables, following recommendations from the literature, and national energy efficiency standards. Simulations were then carried out in Design Builder and Diva to predict final energy consumption for air-conditioning, lighting, and office equipment, and simultaneously, solar photovoltaic energy production on the building skin of the respective models – on the roof, and on the North, East and West facades in PVSYST. Results showed a 46% reduction of the total final energy consumption in the optimized model. This paper showed that it is possible to achieve the NZEB goal in the up-to-four-story office buildings in the climate zone of Brasilia. Thus, the paper provides what was needed to draft a series of guidelines and strategies to use in the energetic renovation of the building complex, buildings towards the achievement of the NZEB goal in the climate zone of Brasilia. The novelty of this research is to apply the concept of NZEB in existing office buildings in Brasilia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper attempts to revisit the nexus between economic growth, carbon emissions, trade openness, financial effectiveness and FDI for a sample of seven developed and developing countries using curvilinear relationship as per environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis over long term. Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the unit root properties of variables (using Clemente–Montañés–Reyes unit root test with double mean shifts and AO model and augmented Dickey–Fuller test) for structural breaks at different levels. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and error correction model (ECM) methodology was used to estimate long- and short-run parameters among the selected variables in sample countries from 1965 to 2016. Vector error correction (VEC) and Granger causality approach was used to determine the direction of causality. Findings: The authors confirmed long-run relationship among the variables and highlighted high economic growth and energy consumption as the main causes of environmental degradation. While in India financial development and FDI inflows depict a negative association with environmental sustainability, however, such relationship was positive in the United Kingdom (UK), which is often considered as a benchmark for policymakers. The authors’ findings were in agreement with existing research insights in reporting FDI and financial development as the major contributors towards (unsustainable) sustainable environment through emissions in case of (developing country like India) developed country like UK. For other sample countries (China, Brazil, Japan, South Africa, United States of America (USA)), the authors’ model failed to capture financial development and FDI as significant contributors of carbon emissions. However, unidirectional causality running from energy to carbon emission was observed leading to the policy adoption of incentivizing alternative energy-based resources to increase energy efficiency across the energy value chain. Research limitations/implications: Manufacturing with renewable energy, in collaboration with private and foreign players, under an institutional framework is desirable. Policy instruments including mandatory administrative controls, economic incentives and voluntary schemes that promote energy efficiency building blocks need to be established. A sound legal system for implementing technological innovation, financial subsidy incentives, interest-free loan programmes and development of financial sector supports creation and thriving of energy efficient units, often a perquisite for accelerated development. Originality/value: By undertaking a comparative analysis, the authors address the research gap through revisiting EKC hypothesis with different set of trade policy and financial development framework. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, earlier studies were limited to one-country data analysis and did not consider the comparative data set of developed and developing countries with reference to financial development and FDI components. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The present work sought to investigate the reasons for installing air conditioning equipment in buildings even under adverse economic conditions and with the awareness of their negative environmental implications. The Faculty of Architecture building at the Federal University of Bahia, located in the city of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil, was the focus of the present investigation. It was determined that the lack of maintenance of the windows and window frames, and the closing of projected openings compromised natural ventilation. The study confirmed the adequacy of the architectural project in relation to the local climate, and in loco measurements likewise confirmed the efficiency of natural ventilation through the windows and other openings in the faculty room and classrooms examined. The results of the interviews concerning thermal comfort indicated that 53% of the users felt comfortable. Nonetheless, it was found that the building's windows and window frames were poorly maintained, compromising their ability to facilitate efficient natural ventilation and significantly diminishing the capacity for thermal regulation in the building. This study calls attention to the necessity of refining and improving the maintenance of university buildings to reduce the intensive use of artificial air conditioning in detriment to investments in projects that could lend priority to natural ventilation and the maintenance of good window operating conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, this study aims to analyse the energy efficiency of a public university building located in southern Brazil. The assessment was carried out according to the Brazilian Technical Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labelling of Commercial, Services and Public Buildings (RTQ-C). In this study, the building envelopment was evaluated under the actual condition and in the reference condition, using the simplified method. The constructive parameters of the building were obtained from the architectural project and technical standards, although the assigned climatic group of the building was defined based on the Brazilian bioclimatic zones. In the end, it was possible to identify the energetic efficiency level of the envelopment through the total annual thermal load of the building in its actual condition. Considering the urban and climatic context, as well as constructive characteristics of the building, strategies were proposed that can be adopted even in the project planning stage, aiming to improve the classification of the envelopment and to meet the energy efficiency policies of the country. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {Green labels have strong potential in identifying buildings with lower load on the natural environment, among which the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) is the most used certification worldwide. LEED's potential in truly reflecting a building's sustainability degree has been receiving criticisms in the scientific literature. The more recent LEED versions represent, in theory, improvements over the previous ones in an attempt to overcome such criticism. This work assesses the way in which LEED certification is pushing buildings towards higher sustainability degrees. Primary data are based on the Brazilian certified buildings up to 2016, totalizing 276 projects evaluated under statistical approaches, including the Kruskall Wallis analysis, credit achievement degree, and skewness indices. Results show that energy & atmosphere and material & resource categories received lower scores among all other categories for the 2009 LEED version than for the 2.0/2.2 version. The 2009 LEED framework allowed the certified Brazilian buildings to pursue those easier-to-obtain scores, which raises doubts about whether the LEED label push to strong sustainability since its core concept is based on energy and material consumption. Notwithstanding, the evaluated projects in Brazil pursue lower degrees of sustainability because they apply efforts in obtaining the minimum scores required by a specific label. Although demanding improvements, LEED certification should be promoted as an important tool towards sustainable development due to its innumerous advantages. © 2019},

	abstract = {In recent years, several tools for building energy analysis and simulation have been developed to assist in increasing building energy performance, harvesting its computing capabilities for a reliable and accurate energy performance prediction. To perform this analysis, energy tools typically require crucial data regarding the building's surrounding environment, which is acquired from neighbouring weather stations. However, these stations often experience hardware malfunctions, resulting in either erroneous or missing data. Traditionally, these values are rectified through empirical and geostatistical methods, which, while reflecting several decades of practice, may prove to be inadequate when considering a purely data-driven approach. To this end, the present study introduces a machine learning methodology proposing the application of regression algorithms to rectify the erroneous values in datasets, and the clustering of weather stations, based on their recorded climatic conditions, to enhance the regression models. A shape-based approach for clustering time series of different climatic parameters and weather stations is pursued, using the k-medoids algorithm alongside dynamic time warping as the similarity measure. Both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models are evaluated as exemplary regression algorithms, with different sets of predictors. Mean Squared Error is used as the performance metric. A data set of different climatic parameters from southeastern Brazil was used, with air temperature being chosen as the response variable, given its importance in energy consumption. Results indicate that a machine learning approach to the problem is indeed viable. ANN slightly outperforms SVR in the prediction of the studied weather variable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {University campuses are comprised of many different types of buildings and thus, to improve their energy efficiency, the benchmarking of these buildings is fundamental. In this regard, this study aimed to develop an energy consumption benchmark for university buildings in Brazil. The benchmark was based on a database obtained through parametric building energy simulation by employing an archetype of a university building, developed by the Brazilian Council for Sustainable Construction (CBCS), and a set of parameter variations. The database was obtained considering nine building parameters (e.g., occupancy, internal loads and envelope features), resulting in 23,256 cases aimed at representing the variety of university buildings countrywide. Therefore, this process is innovative since a benchmark is developed for multiple buildings across the country rather than for only one building on a specific university building or campus. Three machine learning techniques were compared to develop the benchmark, multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The SVM method had the lowest mean absolute error, root mean absolute error and the highest R2 value, and thus it was adopted to develop the benchmark and efficiency scales. The efficiency scale was used to classify the buildings into ‘efficient’, ‘typical’ or ‘inefficient’, and supports the identification of good practice or inefficiency. © 2022},

	abstract = {This research intends to link thermal comfort as an important part of achieving energy efficiency in the operational phase of a building with the use of wood as a low embodied energy and carbon efficient construction material. The thermal performance of a representative multi-story social housing unit with common construction materials is evaluated in contrast to wood-based construction systems in Brazil. A project located in Sao Carlos, Brazil was selected. The construction system for walls consists of concrete blocks while roofs are composed of a fiber cement sheet and a concrete slab ceiling. As alternative wood-based wall systems, plywood panels with an air chamber or three different insulation materials (expanded polystyrene, cellulose and mineralized wood fiber) were tested while two alternative roof systems were analyzed (plywood lining with air chamber or insulation material). The project with common construction materials as well as the wood-based alternatives were evaluated through the Brazilian standard NBR 15575 and the European Standard ISO 13786. Furthermore, a transient simulation was conducted following the procedure established by NBR 15575 and using the adaptive comfort model ASHRAE 55-2013. The analysis evidenced the neglection of the recommended passive design strategies according to the Brazilian Standard 15220 and the psychometric chart of Givoni. In regard to the wood-based constructions, results showed that insulation of mineralized wood fiber in panels performed better than cellulose and expanded polystyrene. The transient simulation also demonstrated better thermal comfort conditions with a hybrid wood-based model compared to the construction typology of the representative project. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {An analysis of Brazilian public costs indicates that, although a significant part of its financial resources is destined for electricity consumption, only a small portion of the distributed generation belongs to public institutions. A technical and economic analysis of a PV power plant in the Brazilian public sector was proposed and various scenarios were evaluated, indicating that a change in the Brazilian tariff policy could be an alternative for boosting PV generation in the public sector. Risk analysis demonstrated that the minimum acceptable rate of return is the variable that most affects the system's viability. In addition, a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) showed that the proposed PV system has a viability probability higher than 92%. A statistical analysis indicated that the system has a probability of at least 80% for supplying more than 25% of the building's peak demand for all seasons. Finally, such systems have also been found to represent an alternative for improving the electricity grid's stability, while supplying part of the building's energy demand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the design stage, many methods to analyse and improve the building performance prediction have been developed by the climate-based building simulation approach. This research aimed to propose a method to analyse the visual and thermal-energy performance of offices buildings with adjustable shading devices. The considered visual criteria were daylight glare probability, daylighting availability and excessive sunlight exposure. Window's solar heat gain and the cooling energy demand were the thermal-energy criteria. A modular building was submitted to the method application. The shading devices effects were compared and the relationships between the hourly variables were analysed. One location (Florianopolis, Brazil) and four façade directions were tested. At the controlled conditions, the occupant was considered in the most vulnerable position and view direction regarding daylight glare, chosen from three positions and five view directions tested at the uncontrolled condition. According to the proposed method, were applied eight shading devices control: two static conditions and three dynamic frequencies guided by two triggers. Three shading devices considering two proprieties sets presented the effects comparison and the better performance, such as the use of the clear roller shades operated by the daily daylight glare control. High correlation and determination coefficients (r e r2) and better defined-trends, were indicated firstly between illuminance and solar radiation and secondly between the daylight glare probability and the window's solar heat gain. The dynamic controls showed coefficients lower than the static conditions, demonstrating a correspondence reduction between the shading devices effects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) of Brazil, in a bid to encourage energy-conscious energy consumption, has proposed a new sustainable energy tariff modality (the White Tariff) based on off-peak usage. This study aims to compare and contrast situations in which the White Tariff alone is used, and where it is combined with power generation from a generator set or a photovoltaic cell energy system to reduce energy costs. Furthermore, economic, environmental, and social advantages are outlined in the project summaries. Interviews and documentary analyses were conducted in a technology park that uses only the White Tariff and in condominiums that combine the White Tariff with a generator set or a photovoltaic cell system. The data generated was fed into the database of the Horosazonal software to obtain an overview of these companies. Results show that the company adopting the White Tariff alone achieved 19% and US$14,684 in annual savings. However, when the White Tariff is combined with a generator set, the smart grid project proved to be more efficient over time as it obtained an annual benefit of US$35,832 and 62.38% savings. In contrast, the smart grid project combining a photovoltaic cell energy system with the White Tariff achieved an annual benefit of US$52,712, with 68.31% savings and was 1.3 to 5.3 times more profitable than other projects, demonstrating that it was the best smart grip project studied. Furthermore, opting for the White Tariff produced advantages such as a reduction in energy consumption expenses, contributing to a reduction in power outages and blackouts, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and boosting the company image within society. This study shows that energy-conscious consumption combined with the use of renewable energy sources is environmentally and economically advantageous and can provide future generations with a healthier environment in which people can make use of natural resources in a sustainable manner that is sustainable for planet earth. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The energy performance of 11 bank branches in the Brazilian city of Curitiba was analysed using bottom-up engineering energy benchmarking method. As part of a previous study to classify bank buildings, these bank branches were selected for a further study with their building parametric and energy-related data obtained from building drawings and specifications as well as on-site surveys. The energy assessment of these branches was conducted using the existing (RTQ-C) and proposed (INI-C) Brazilian energy efficient labelling regulations for non-domestic buildings. The ability of both systems to produce results which are compatible and could be used to reflect the actual building energy consumption was examined. The study shows improvement of the INI-C system with calculation of energy consumption values and conditions for different reference buildings. However, performance gap between the calculated and actual energy consumption was found due to various reasons including reference values for office buildings were inaccurate for bank buildings. Hence, a list of modified reference values was proposed for bank buildings to represent bank buildings more accurately. This paper highlights the strengths and limitations of both the existing and proposed regulations and presents a reality check against the calculations of energy ratings and actual energy consumption of the buildings. It was concluded that the existing and proposed regulations have to be improved significantly in terms of calculation methodology in order to meet the demand of future energy policy in Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Due to the great participation of air conditioning in the electric consumption of the building under study, the following proposals were studied: the exchange of the current split air conditioning units by a Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) system; the application of solar control films on the glasses; and both options together. The methodology followed these steps: firstly, it was simulated the current electricity consumption and the results were validated with real measures; secondly, the retrofitting measures were sized and implemented in the program and the energy savings were quantified; finally, an economic analysis was performed in order to determine the feasibility of the proposals. As a result, the VRF system showed an annual saving in air-conditioning of 42.08% related to the mini-split system. The annual electricity savings were 32.01, 2.14 and 32.80% for the VRF, solar control films, and both options together, respectively. The feasibility analysis of the VRF, considering financing and for a scenario consistent with the historical average growth of the electricity prices and inflation rate, showed that the use of a VRF instead of the splits units recovers the initial investment in 14 years. The application of solar control films proved to be economically unfeasible. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa. All rights reserved.},

Yet, it is important to widen the knowledge about how those buildings have been designed and built in practice, and which design parameters have greater influence on its energy performance. The aim of this paper was to evaluate how building envelope design parameters influence the energy performance of cellular mixed-mode office buildings, in order to identify key design variables. The analysis presents a comparison among literature research studies and typical construction practices from a sample of buildings located in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. According to a base case model, established based on the real buildings sample, three sensitivity analysis techniques were performed to obtain relative parameter sensitivity to thermal loads: OFAT, Morris and Monte Carlo. Results showed the importance of the window opening effective area and the reduced impact of the window-to-wall ratio on the energy performance of mixed-mode office buildings. By applying a multivariate regression model, it showed significant in predicting 78.1% of the variance in annual thermal loads. The accurate determination of annual thermal loads into mixed-mode office buildings can be used to optimize the envelope characteristics based on a combination of input data and the building geometry. Findings from this study could also be applied to other locations, provided that similar climatic environment and urban context are taken into account. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this scenario, the strong correlation of sustainable buildings and smart buildings is evident in the Brazilian case, which has traditional governmental programs that promote the efficient use of energy as a sustainability strategy, with emphasis on buildings, which must follow the international trend, adopting the Net Zero Energy Buildings. Also noteworthy is the considerable increase in the distributed generation of electric energy, building a favorable scenario for the investment in smart buildings.

	abstract = {Green building technologies and practices have been diffused globally along the progress of urban development and renewal. An increasing number of studies focus on the diffusion progress as a social movement. The concept of “green building movement (GBM)” has emerged in multiple disciplines for years; however, its definition remains ambiguous. This paper reports an approach to benchmarking GBM with a case study in the context of Brazil. The benchmarking approach includes a conceptual framework and four key performance indicators (KPIs) which are the institutional organization, professional organization, public policy, and public behavior. The case study results in best practices for Brazil to promote green buildings. The findings identify a GBM paradigm that indicates a pathway in the sequence of: formation of government agency; enactment of laws and regulations; introduction of new industry standards; emergence of incentive policies; and market adoption of green buildings. The findings highlight GBM as top-down progress and suggest a strong involvement from the political realm. The findings also underline big social events as a great opportunity to accelerate GBM. The implications produced from this study are applicable for policymakers in Brazil and other developing countries to adopt green buildings and facilitate a sustainable society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Building upon the knowledge accumulated from a comprehensive research program on double skin façades (DSFs), this study explores two design enhancements for buildings in tropical climates. Thermal and energetic benefits of the inclusion of mechanical ventilation within the DSF cavity and electricity generation from the PV systems have been determined across a wide spectrum of Brazilian climates. Using computational simulations, DSF models with two fan configurations, placed solely at the top of the DSF and distributed along the height of the cavity, are evaluated. Annual distribution of thermal comfort acceptance and impact on energy demands from HVAC systems and contribution from the PV systems is analyzed. Results demonstrated wide variations of energy performance in relation to the climatic conditions. The ‘Cool’ climate zone presented most significant benefits from the proposed design enhancements resulting in electricity surplus. On the other hand, electricity generated from PV in the moderate climate zone can only cover about 30% of the HVAC energy consumption, whereas energy savings in the ‘hot’ zone are the lowest with only 15% of electricity contributed from the PV systems. The results of this paper contribute to the early stage of design when considering the adoption of DSF in tropical climates. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Worldwide the construction industry presents a significant demand for new technologies ensuring certainty, cost-effectiveness and time efficiency. Modern construction relies on digital resources, and one of the most prominent novelties is Building Information Modelling (BIM). Construction planning effectiveness is based on clear communication and integration between project planners and other participants, such as engineers, architects, suppliers, and workforce. The possible connection between 3D models and time or scheduling potentially reduces misconception risks and lack of information to avoid re-scheduling and project delivery delays. This study aims to investigate the integration of Revit, Navisworks, Tally and Green Building Studio for identifying the challenges in applying 4D BIM technology using a case study in a developing country (Brazil). The research method used comprised these steps: objectives definition, literature review, development of the 4D analysis and evaluation, case study for validation with comparison to other comparable and contrasting studies, and discussion of the results. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and challenges to adopt BIM technology to thrive better communication for teams and stakeholders through the various construction stages via visual representation. Additionally, despite the obstacles and difficulties to integrate different software, it is beneficial to the decision-makers, not only focus on the constructability perspective but project’s environmental impacts, such as energy efficiency and global warming effect. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the buildings sector requires a full understanding of the factors influencing emissions over the life-cycle of buildings, particularly in places where large additions to the building stock are expected. Currently, little is known about what affects the GHG emissions of buildings located in warmer climates, a typical situation for many emerging economies. This paper presents a study of emissions from Brazilian office buildings using building archetypes. A sensitivity analysis explores possible parameter ranges, various contributions to life-cycle impacts and their key drivers. For each of the 1000 building variations in the sample, the emissions were calculated using a life-cycle assessment. Multivariate regression analysis enabled the study of the results’ sensitivity to 10 parameters, influencing building operation, design and others. The emissions ranged from 20 to 106 kg CO2-eq/m2 gross floor area and year. Electricity mix, climate and cooling efficiency were the most impactful parameters, but building component service time was also significant. POLICY RELEVANCE Emerging economies are expected to rapidly increase their building stock and energy use, particularly for cooling in the coming decades. The findings show the key factors influencing the GHG emissions of office buildings in warm climates, typical for many emerging economies, such as Brazil. For effective mitigation, priority should be placed on reducing the carbon intensity of electricity and encouraging highly efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. Policymakers may want to offer incentives for office buildings with a combination of natural ventilation and mechanical cooling, because they were less emission-intensive in every investigated city. The benefits are the biggest for buildings in which a high proportion of windows can be opened for natural ventilation. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: There is a great interest in developing eco-friendly operations as alternative uses of resources in the university campus, making the employment of technologies more sustainable. Practices such as energy management and efficiency initiatives have been encouraged to meet these sustainability goals. The purpose of this paper is to describe and discuss the main features of the GENIIOT project, a system of energy management using Internet of Things applied in a Brazilian university campus to support energy education practices and to promote lasting energy efficiency measures. The focus of the study is directed at the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system, which is responsible for 40% of the total electricity consumption. In addition, this project also scrutinizes processes such as the building occupants’ comfort demands, lighting levels and energy waste control. Design/methodology/approach: A case study at the Unicamp campus was conducted to illustrate the design procedures through qualitative description. This study comprises an overview of the physical plant, hardware and software development, energy data monitoring, management process and energy education. Findings: The GENIIOT project enables energy efficiency actions by concerning the use of air-conditioning equipment based on monitored data, different types of monitored rooms, user’s behaviors and their feedback. This initiative requires the engagement, awareness and actions from users combined with investment in energy efficiency to achieve an efficient use of this type of equipment. The proposed approach can be applied in the future to similar situations, inside the Unicamp campus and at other university campuses. In addition, this project can contribute to building efficiency analysis by using the hardware structure developed to monitor facilities and carry out evaluations, providing valuable information for strategic initiatives in energy efficiency projects and research and development programs based on practical experience and promoting a discussion about sustainability aspects in the context of the university campus for energy efficiency. Originality/value: The GENIIOT project is aligned with some of the sustainable development goals, among which sustainability and responsible consumption are identified. Considering the sustainability issues, the economic dimension can be evaluated through a cost–benefit analysis of energy efficiency projects with prudent investment, while the social attractiveness of the project is ensured by education and awareness practices for the community that interacts with the system and learns about a more efficient way of using resources in the campus. Furthermore, there is a more conscious use of natural resources by minimizing waste from the use of electricity and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. GENIIOT is part of Sustainable Campus Project, a living laboratory which aims at developing energy-efficiency-related research activities in the university campus to reduce costs in higher and federal institutions of education in Brazil. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Concentrated solar power has considerable potential for growth in Brazil, considering the levels of direct solar irradiation, land availability and low current state of use of this technology. It has also a good potential to replace fossil fuels in many thermal applications, helping to decarbonize Brazilian Energy Matrix. The prototype was manually built in a garage. It was made of the following materials: plywood, with steel tube reinforcements for the structure; copper, covered with black ink, for the collector tube; galvanized steel sheets covered with thin aluminum sheets for the reflector. A hydraulic system was developed to run the tests, and an electronic system, using an Arduino-UNO, a laptop and temperature and flow meter sensors to collect data. This prototype does not have neither a solar tracking system nor a glass cover. It has an opening area of 2.34 m2 and had a material cost of around $129.00. Under an estimated direct solar irradiation of 900 W/m2, the prototype was able to absorb heat at a rate of 1.2 kW (52.38% of efficiency). It was also created a simplified method for building similar devices. For the purpose this prototype was built, the materials of the collector tube and the reflector were considered approved. The plywood in the structure had a low reliability and high cost. The results found have limitations for industrial applications, but can offer strategical information for building this type of device in universities and research centers. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Measuring the environmental performances by indicators is considered as a crucial step to keep track of progress towards sustainability. This study compares trends in environmental sustainability indicators worldwide, Portugal, Brazil and two universities in these countries. The data collection is done based on findings from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) between 2007 and 2017, and reports from both universities between 2010 and 2018. As a result, it can be seen that global Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased (10.6 to 9 ton/capita). Portugal also reduced its CO2 till 2014 (5.2 to 4.6 ton/capita) but experienced a raise in its rates in the following years. Brazil experienced a growth in its CO2 (1.7 to 2 ton/capita), as did the Portuguese university (0.85 to 0.87ton/alumnus). World municipal waste decreased (541.8 to 524.4 kg/capita), as well as in Portugal until 2013 (513.7 to 436.7 kg/capita), but in the following years increased. Similarly, Brazil reduced the indexes until 2011 (271.9 to 266.8 kg/capita) and increased in 2012. In the Portuguese university, the rates increased until 2014 (4.02 to 9.02 kg/student) and reduced in 2015, as in the Brazilian university that increased until 2018 (19.53 to 25.08kg/student). Portugal, Brazil, and the two universities pointed out a trend of increasing emissions and waste while the world data a reduction. The Brazilian university had higher municipal waste rates than Portugal. The consumption of water and energy in the Portuguese university decreased while it increased the Brazilian university. Actions have already been undertaken at universities to lower the environmental burden by improving the energy efficiency of buildings through the use of cleaner energy, setting up mobility studies, and campaigns to reduce consumption and cut down waste generation. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Therefore, an outreach project has been idealized by the Renewable Energy Research Group (GPER, which belongs to the Federal University of Santa Catarina) seeking to disseminate recent scientific results achieved by the group. The progress of this outreach project, “Automation and Renewable Energies” (ARE), is discussed in this paper. This project entertained visits to local public schools in Florianópolis (capital of the Santa Catarina state), aiming to encourage high school students to be future CAE actors and, to urge their interest of this course, correlating this degree with the topic of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Moreover, the development of scaled renewable energy testbeds is also discussed; these small mock-ups make an allusion to why control-oriented purposes are of most important to the RES context, given that adequate control strategies can be used to maximize global efficiency and allow the adequate integration of renewable sources to modern electric networks. © 2019.

	abstract = {Natural ventilation portrays an effective technique for lowering the internal temperature, without spending electricity, and directly contributes to the renewal of indoor air by establishing a healthy environment for workers. Given this, it is usual to have air vent openings located at the top of the roof (continuous roof vents), in addition to those present on the facades of sheds. In naturally ventilated buildings, it is recommended to give due importance to the provision of these openings, since depending on the proposed arrangement, the wind may or may not help in the effectiveness of this strategy. In this work, it is evaluated via computer simulation (EnergyPlus, version 8.7.0), for the climatic conditions of the city of Belo Horizonte/Brazil, the influence of the wind direction in the flow rate of indoor air through the ridge vents, of the longitudinal and transversal type, present in industrial sheds endowed with an internal source of high-intensity heat release. The results obtained show that the flow rate has a symmetrical behavior in the openings of the longitudinal continuous roof vent, that is, when an opening is with the maximum outflow of the internal air, the opening opposite the predominant wind direction is acting as an entry point for the air external. The transverse continuous roof vents are more sensitive about the wind direction since they are positioned perpendicular to the building. The best result found is for the wind situation occurring parallel to the shed, obtaining a reduction in the internal temperature of up to 1°C, an increase in the rate of air changes per hour, in the internal environment, at 1acph, and an increase of up to 10,7% in the volume of air infiltrated into the shed. © 2021, Scipedia S.L..

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore students’ sustainability attitudes and behavioural intentions and their relation to energy use, to promote energy saving and decarbonisation in higher education settings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a validated energy literacy survey to assess undergraduate students’ attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy saving in two countries (Brazil and Belgium). The questionnaire, administered online, comprised 23 Likert scale questions and three questions eliciting socio-demographic information. Results were analysed using a linear regression model and compared with previous research using the same energy literacy instrument. Findings: The research identified three dimensions of sustainable attitudes: citizens’ role, scientists’ role and government’s role, explaining 65.5% of respondents’ energy-related attitudes. Three dimensions of sustainable behaviours were identified, explaining 64.5% of energy-related behavioural intentions: consumption of eco-friendly products, financially driven behaviours and household energy saving. The linear regression model identified scientists’ role, consumption of eco-friendly products and financially driven behaviour as the key predictors of student energy use. Differences between the two contexts also emerged. Research limitations/implications: Individual action to improve energy saving is necessary, but not sufficient for decarbonisation. However, student attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy are an important element of campus decarbonisation: these “micro” experiments can become a “network” searching for synergies at the campus level (in collaboration with the neighbourhood) and act as a catalyst towards a more profound carbon-free society. Limitations of the research include the use of a survey to ascertain estimates of energy use; however, the study offers a model for further research and a mode of analysis that would be useful to other researchers. Practical implications: This research enables universities to better understand the drivers and barriers to student energy-saving activities and thereby promote decarbonisation on campus. This is a crucial underpinning in the creation of sustainable universities, linking education and campus developments. This survey was one of the catalysts to set up a total new maintenance energy performance contract (MEPC) at one of the authors’ institutions, where energy efficiency was realised alongside other sustainability aspects, such as water saving, circular renovation and waste reduction. Social implications: This research illustrates the challenges and opportunities of working with key stakeholders in university settings for university-based decarbonisation efforts. Intensive involvement of students and teachers in the new MEPC offers an example of co-creation with building “users” – which may have implications for other university building developments. Increasingly, universities need to consider the need for a new business model in which shared and multiple value creation is a key feature. Treating societal challenges as business opportunities is an important new dimension of corporate strategy and a powerful path to social progress, which higher education institutions should not overlook. Originality/value: Student attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy are an important element of campus decarbonisation and can act as a catalyst towards a carbon-free society. Although energy literacy research has been undertaken in the USA and UK, this research is the first of its kind for Belgium and Brazil, and the mode of analysis – using a linear regression model – differs from the earlier work, offering a novel methodological approach. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The green wall concept has been introduced as one of the solutions to reduce energy demand for ventilation requirements while improving the natural vegetation in dense urban areas. Past studies revealed that the energy-saving of green walls can vary substantially, from 35% to 90% across countries such as United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Russia, Greece, China, Saudi Arabia, India, and Brazil. Given these differences in energy saving of green walls due to climatic conditions and other reasons, direct application of such findings to the Sri Lankan context is questionable. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the thermal performance of green wall applications in Sri Lanka through a case study analysis of an indirect green façade with a comparative conventional wall. The required data were extracted through on-site temperature measurements from different points of both the exterior and interior wall surfaces of each building in different time intervals per day for a period of fourteen days spanning from October to November. The analysis shows that the green walls contribute to 21%-36% of temperature difference compared to the conventional wall. Eventually, this results in 0.06 kWh of energy-saving per m2of wall area, and thereby green walls contribute to the 80% energy saving for ventilation requirements. Hence, the study recommends that the use of green walls can be considered as one of the energy efficiency solutions while improving natural vegetation in tropical climatic cities and absorbing other benefits of green walls. © 2021, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

A country-wide dataset was used, comprising 10,000 buildings divided into 12 typologies. Key indicators include floor area, energy use intensity, and operation patterns. In addition, predominant wall constructions, lighting systems, equipment, water heating, and HVAC systems for each typology were identified, including average density power for the systems. Data from the Brazilian Energy Balance report was correlated with the sample of buildings to determine the proportion of each building typology in the total energy consumption of the country, considering different energy sources. This study provides an innovative and up-to-date status of the characteristics of non-residential buildings in Brazil. A complementary statistical analysis addressed the correlation between energy use intensity and the building characteristics including an ANOVA test and a regression analysis in order to investigate the influence of the energy usage indicators (Lighting Power Density, Equipment Power Density, Cooling capacity) on the energy use intensity of each building typology in Brazil. This study is intended to serve as a reference for building characteristics and building energy performance in Brazil, and hence support diverse research regarding country-level building stock modeling, energy benchmarking, climate change impacts, and energy-efficiency related studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Radiative cooling (RC) can provide free cooling by emitting radiative heat into outer space. This article presents the effects of solar radiation, non-radiative heat gains, atmospheric conditions, and spectral selectivity on the performance of radiative cooling technologies. Radiative cooling materials, including polymeric structures, pigmented paints, and photonic structures, are also reviewed. The benefits of integrating RC structures into buildings are reviewed, including estimates of energy and cost savings, and payback period. Methods for determining the global warming potential (GWP) when carrying out a life-cycle assessment (LCA) for RC structures are also presented. These LCA methods include two primary mechanisms through which radiative cooling technologies reduce GWP: 1) by directly reducing radiative forcing by radiating energy to outer space, and 2) by indirectly reducing radiative forcing by decreasing cooling loads, which reduces the CO2 emissions associated with providing power for cooling. Estimates for exemplary case studies show that by installing radiative cooling technologies the GWP for cooling houses in Jamaica, Ghana and Brazil over a 20 year period can be reduced by ∼40,000 kg CO2-eq, ∼14,000 kgCO2-eq, and ∼22,000 kgCO2-eq, respectively. In most cases, the dominant reason for the decrease in the GWP is the reduction in CO2 emissions achieved by reducing the building cooling load. However, the emission of long wavelength radiation and the corresponding reduction in radiative forcing is significant and is the dominant factor reducing the GWP for some cases. The limitations and future prospects for RC technologies in building applications are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the last decades, the initial phase of the design process has been discussed from the point of view of the construction process economy contribution. In this sense, several authors highlight the decisions made at this stage as an impacting point of influence on the direct cost of the building. This concern is repeated in the cases investigated by the ZEMCH (Zero Energy Mass Custom Homes) group in Brazil, which is focused on social housing, consequently, cost becomes a fundamental factor that must be considered on these buildings' life cycle. Furthermore, ZEMCH's workshops in Brazil have characterized the initial phase of the design process as a process that requires speed and simultaneous control of a large amount of data by the designers. Over these perspectives, the objective of this work in progress is to verify the potential of a diagrammatic artifact as an intuitive tool of visualizing information and supporting decision making in the initial phase of the urban land subdivision design process, to obtain energy efficiency during the building's life cycle. Therefore, diagramming information of the environmental conditions into a visualization tool, helps designers to deal with requirements of this phase and cause impact on the operational cost of the building. This research was conducted over the Design Science Research method, and concludes that although visualizing information with the aid of an artifact can play an important role for the practical requirements of the early design phases, the solution can be potentially expanded to other purposes such as teaching, and even for users self-awareness on the operational impact. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The universalization of electricity still presents significant obstacles to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. There are still many remote areas, such as oceanic islands and isolated communities disconnected from the grid, that depend on fossil fuels to make it viable. Fernando de Noronha, a tropical oceanic island in Brazil, is a typical case where replacing the diesel-based power plant for renewable energy is imperative, therefore, it served as a testbed for this investigation. This paper presents the implementation and results of a low-cost framework for assessing the photovoltaic potential of rooftops. Using a real case study, the objective is to explore how effective rooftop photovoltaic systems could be on Fernando de Noronha Island by applying low-cost aerophotogrammetry, geospatial analysis and scenario creation. The first approach was mapping buildings, open spaces and solar obstacles using unmanned aerial photogrammetric survey that delivered high-quality digital elevation surface. The 3D rooftop surfaces fed the solar irradiation models and enabled to compute the photovoltaic potential of suitable rooftops. Findings show that 83.3% of the total building rooftop area was deemed economically viable for photovoltaic installations. Furthermore, 80.0% and 60.0% of the rooftops receive annual irradiation levels >1600 kWh/m2 and 2000 kWh/m2, respectively, indicating high potential for exploiting solar resources on decentralized, highly irradiated rooftops. The scenario with the highest photovoltaic potential is three times higher than the lowest. The results indicate that the suitability of rooftops for various photovoltaic system sizes offers the possibility of deploying a combination of smaller and larger urban photovoltaic installations. Furthermore, the decentralized photovoltaic rooftops can compensate for between 66 and 199% of the estimated annual consumption of 31 GWh in 2031. The method is highly transferrable and limited solely by the availability of sources of geospatial data and coordination with stakeholders. The investigation meets the needs of the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy, therefore meeting the environmental needs of the energy sector by promoting renewable energy for the island which is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site and Brazilian National Marine Park and Environmental Protected Area. The investigation demonstrated that creating photovoltaic potential scenarios that nurture informed decision-making processes is a crucial initial step in urban renewable energy planning. The pioneering 2000-ha unmanned aerial photogrammetric survey proved to be a cost-efficient method for producing accurate data for modeling the irradiation and photovoltaic potential in urban areas. The investigation fills the literature gap on modeling photovoltaic potential for remote islands by blending unmanned aerial vehicles and geospatial tools. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: In developing countries, such as Brazil, the construction sector is consistently focused on the construction of new buildings, and there is no dissemination of the preservation, restoration and maintenance of historic buildings. Idle buildings, due to the use and lack of maintenance, present pathological manifestations, such as moisture problems that compromise specially their thermal and energy performance. With this in mind, the purpose of this work is to create a digital model using terrestrial photogrammetry and suggest retrofit interventions based on computer simulation to improve the thermal and energy performance of a historical building. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed methodology combined terrestrial photogrammetry using common smartphones and commercial software for historical buildings with building information modeling (historic building information modeling (HBIM)) and building energy modeling (BEM). The approach follows five steps: planning, site visit, data processing, data modeling and results. Also, as a case study, the School of Architecture and Urbanism of the Fluminense Federal University, built in 1888, was chosen to validate the approach. Findings: A digital map of pathological manifestations in the HBIM model was developed, and interventions considering the application of expanded polystyrene in the envelope to reduce energy consumption were outlined. From the synergy between HBIM and BEM, it was concluded that the information modeled using photogrammetry was fundamental to create the energy model, and simulations were needed to optimize the possible solutions in terms of energy consumption. Originality/value: Firstly, the work proposes a reasonable methodology to be applied in development countries without sophisticated technologies, but with acceptable precision for the study purpose. Secondly, the presented study shows that the use of HBIM for energy modeling proved to be useful to simulate possible solutions that optimize the thermal and energy performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Daylighting is one of the environmental resources that deliver quality to the built area by making it more comfortable and efficient and by promoting people's well-being, besides reducing the consumption of electrical energy. The amount of daylighting indoors is related to the construction features, whose parameters are those of the urban legislation, as well as to the location features where the building stands. This research aimed to get a better knowledge of the interference of the urban typologies of Marilandia, Espírito Santo (Brazil), in the availability of daylight in the internal environment. The methodology consisted of the identification and representation of the main typologies found in the city, or of those which might be built due to the current construction law; computer simulations of three sky patterns CIE (3, 7 and 12) using the Troplus 6 program; and the analysis of the results. Founded on this analysis, it was possible to see that the application of the current urban legislation has favored the better use of daylighting inside the constructions through the allowed front setback, which is three meters, and the number of floors allowed in each building, which is eight. As for the use of daylighting, the Typology 03 presented the best performance, making it possible to have a more comfortable environment with better energy savings potential. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Earth-air heat exchangers (EAHE) represent a sustainable way to explore the soil to heat or cool buildings. Due to the Earth's thermal inertia, its superficial layers can be used as a heat source or sink, respectively, in the winter or summer. Hence, the EAHE employ buried ducts where the air is forced to flow and exchange heat with the soil. Such devices demand little energy, as they can use low powered fans or passive techniques for natural convection. Recurrent issues in the literature of EAHE explore how to improve their performances by analyzing their operational parameters; soil, climate, and global economic prospects; the development and validation of complete or simplified simulation models. This paper presents parameter analysis of EAHE to increase their thermal potentials (which is also related to the efficiency and the prospects for thermal comfort) and the heat exchanges (linked with the economy) considering a Brazilian city in a subtropical climate. The research uses simulations based on a validated 1D model. It is compared with three others, including 3D ones, giving more accurate results. Unlike most works covering 1D models, the methodology proposed here allows the study of multi-layered soils. After assessing the soil temperature variations, the results point out that most of the local thermal potential is attainable at relatively low depths, with magnitude peaks of 5°C. The parameter analyses are focused on this target potential, addressing changes in the airspeed, length, and diameter of the ducts. For all cases, the goal was achieved, allowing to obtain annual efficiencies close to 90%. However, only the tests increasing the length also increased the quantity of heat exchanged (in about 20%) and, consequently, proved to be economically affordable. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the performance-based design context, buildings can be evaluated through simulation procedures to estimate their performance in different environmental criteria. In this context, a crucial issue is the identification of the most influent input variables in some specific performance criteria, which can only be appropriately assessed through a robust sensitivity analysis approach. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop a method to estimate the influence of design variables in the thermal and energy performance of buildings through a systematic procedure, using building simulation programmes and statistical tools. The method has a broad scope of combining a local with a global sensitivity analysis using the Morris elementary effects method, and uncertainty analysis of the performance criteria. A case study of a low-income house located in southern Brazil was evaluated and simulated in the EnergyPlus™ programme. Four different performance criteria were considered (such as the degree-hours for heating and cooling and the energy consumption for heating and cooling). The simulation experiment considered 21 design variables, such as the thermal properties of the construction components, openings characteristics, airflow parameters and solar orientation of the house. The study identified the most influential design variable in each criterion, highlighting the thermal transmittance and the solar absorptance of the roof, and the ventilation area of the windows. The combination of the local and global approaches leads to a better understanding of the behaviour of the model and can help the decision-maker to optimise the building performance more accurately. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Thus, for the first time in a Brazilian public agency BookFeel was used as a calculation tool based on the Compound Method Based on Financial Accounts (MC3) approach, which considered the financial expenses of the agency to estimate part of Scope 3 emissions. The total CF 2017 was 5,257.92 tCO2e, 83% of which belong to Scope 3, with “purchase of products/services” as the largest issuer. This case study showed that Scope 3 calculation in public agencies is indispensable, with BookFeel and MC3 being able to calculate the CF in a practical way. It also provided some strategies to mitigate the carbon emissions in public agencies, which should prioritize green public procurement and eco-innovation of its supply chain, eco-efficiency in consumption of materials and services, biofuels, high energy efficiency in public buildings and new management strategies such as the home office.

	abstract = {Energy efficient buildings require envelopes designed to fit the local and the climate zone while the greatest benefit of opaque ventilated façades is the ability to reduce cooling thermal loads. The natural convection in the air chambers and the protection against solar incidence provided by the external layer reduces the energy consumed by the artificial systems used for environmental conditioning (HVAC systems). This research investigates the energy benefit of opaque ventilated façades compared to cladding façades in multi-floor residential buildings located in nine climate zones, according to the Köeppen-Geiger classification, in Brazil. To this end, computational simulations using software from the same company, capable of automatically synchronizing the modeling data and energy analysis of a whole year were used. Also, the cost of implementing the system in different locations was determined in order to analyze the cost-benefit of the system against the yearly energy benefits. The greatest energy benefits, as well as the best cost-benefits, were found in the hottest regions, demonstrating that this system is relevant for the climate conditions in Brazil and its use should be encouraged since the largest area of the country is located in hot climate zones. Despite the similar results found for cities in the same climate regions, there were also significant differences among them so an individual analysis taking into account the influence of wind speed and rainfall should be performed as well. The study evaluated a wide sampling, 16 cities from all climatic zones, unlike the current studies that were conducted between 2010 and 2018 in Europe, having as main contribution the analysis of an entire building over the period of one year, becoming the most complete research to date, conducted with great speed enabled by the adopted computer simulation methods. This research shows that the behavior of ventilated façade is an improvement in terms of passive cooling of the building compared to cladding facades, offering energy electric savings up to 43% yearly, in the hottest cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This work presents an extensive study on methodologies to calibrate electric energy consumption in buildings. A comparison between several calibration methodologies shows different approaches addressing the same issue, suggesting a lack of a unique methodology that is reproducible for every building. Additionally, no methodology fits the Brazilian public context, such as the predominance of Unitary Air Conditioning Systems (UACS) and buildings which have operated for more than 30 years. A new calibration methodology for performance simulation is proposed to deal with such features. The methodology is separated into two evidence-based steps according to the size of the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems used to control buildings’ indoor environments: the first step is dedicated to calibrating medium-and large-sized HVAC systems, and the second step is dedicated to calibrating small-sized HVAC systems. University Hospital of University of São Paulo (UH-USP) is used as a test bed to implement the proposed methodology. Accuracy indicators show the efficiency of the methodology in terms of calibrating a simulation of the whole UH-USP building and Chilled Water Plant on a monthly basis in terms of accuracy and the time needed to perform the calibration. However, regarding simulation of UACS, the application of the methodology was inconclusive. This study leaves open the question of the trade-off between increasing model outcome accuracy and the strictness of accuracy indicators applied to UACS and poorly automated large-sized air conditioners. © 2021 by the authors.

As a result, policymakers and problem solvers in emerging economies have shown a keen interest in the transition to sustainable energy systems. Nevertheless, the design of sustainable energy solutions in low-income markets presents many challenges, such as those related to limited financial resources and poor infrastructure. In lowincome markets, the adoption of a systems-oriented approach to product-service combinations may represent a promising alternative to traditional design approaches and result in a more socially and environmentally sound path to economic development. Building on design theory grounded in systems theory, this paper analyzes multiple aggregation levels of the sociotechnical system of a low-income energy efficiency program in Brazil. In this study, the authors examined findings from the literature, carried out field observations, and had discussions with practitioners and experts. The study identifies constraints that hinder energy solutions that could achieve higher levels of socioeconomic and environmental benefits in low-income energy markets. Based on the findings, the paper provides insights into sustainable energy transitions and concludes that low-income energy efficiency programs can be improved through design-led policy and stakeholder collaboration. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Energy benchmarking are used to compare the operational performance of buildings with the corresponding stock. Multi-criteria methods emerged to consider different factors in benchmarking assessment. However, there is a lack in considering occupants’ thermal satisfaction in methods based on actual data. The objective of this article is to propose a method to integrate thermal satisfaction into energy benchmarking. The main innovation is to propose a probabilistic metric that takes into account energy consumption, construction aspects, climate conditions, systems and thermal satisfaction level to benchmark a building. The method consists of a statistical analysis to select relevant variables in the building stock, the process of discretisation of such variables, and the developing and validation of a Bayesian Network to serve as an instrument for the benchmarking method. A detailed evidence-based dataset of 426 schools in Brazil was used. Results showed that buildings with low thermal satisfaction of occupants were benchmarked as less efficient than those with high thermal satisfaction and similar energy consumption. Regarding the validation step, the benchmarking model achieved an error rate ranging from 17.78% to 29.17%. The main conclusion is that machine learning techniques can adequately integrate subjective aspects such as occupant satisfaction in data-driven energy benchmarking methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The water, energy and food nexus approach recognize the interconnections between water, energy and food systems and, in order for their integrated management to be efficient and sustainable, proposes that it occur within governance processes. In Brazil, participation spaces for public policy management establish potential institutional arrangements to house the governance nexus. Based on this understanding, one of the most critical contexts for water security in the country was the area of the sources of the Cantareira System. In it, the nexus is understood from the inter-relationships between the production of food (milk and meat), bioenergy (firewood and coal) and water security. The article considers characteristics of public spaces aimed at the participatory management of environmental policies and sustainable rural development to analyze whether their institutional arrangements would allow for a nexus governance process delimited by the area of contribution of the reservoirs of the Cantareira System. For the research, secondary data were used for documental analysis (laws, minutes, technical documents) and primary data collected in interviews with actors who participated in these spaces. The public spaces focused on municipal management councils, the conservation unit councils, and the watershed committee. Despite having desirable characteristics to a process of nexus governance, such as having multiple actors and having a participative character, none of the arrangements analyzed would carry such proposal. In addition to not having as an exclusive scale of action the area of the Cantareira System, these spaces are guided by sectorial objectives and do not engage food and bioenergy producers. Thus, building governance nexus water, energy and food would require efforts to adapt the space that presents the most favorable characteristics, the watershed committee. © 2021 Universidade Federal do Parana.

	abstract = {Bottom-up energy benchmarking methods use simulation of reference buildings to reproduce the building stock performance. Regressive methods using those simulated outcomes are employed to obtain typical energy performance values according to certain parameters to make the benchmarking a fair comparison. Those parameters are commonly related to the building construction aspects, operation and climate conditions. However, the building shape might play an important role in its energy performance, especially due to self-shading. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of using different reference buildings’ shapes to develop a bottom-up benchmarking of schools in Brazil. Seven reference buildings were obtained through a building stock analysis and simulated for different scenarios. Regressive benchmarking models were developed for each shape, and the impact of different building shapes was measured through a cross-validation step. Finally, an ANOVA test was applied to determine the variance of using different regressive benchmarking models in different building shapes. Results showed a significant difference in benchmarking buildings using regressions built using different shapes of reference buildings. Average RMSE ranged from 11.79 to 6.79. The best regression model was the one built using all shapes together. Additionally, results included the benchmarking models with adequate R2 (ranging from 0.725 to 0.885), and the sensitivity analysis indicates the city, the air-conditioned area and the shape as the relevant variables for benchmarking. Conclusions pointed out that the shape is an important factor in bottom-up benchmarking models and, by testing the models using actual cases, the benchmarking result might change significantly according to the reference building shape used to build the benchmarking model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Occupants' adaptive strategies play an important role in the energy consumption of office buildings. Previous research has mostly focused on the adaptive strategies triggered by occupants' indoor discomfort; however, it is crucial to understand if specific adaptive strategies are linked to occupants' energy-saving intentions. This study explores the relationships among employees’ heuristic decision-making in their first choice of adaptive strategies (technological solutions or personal adjustments) when facing extreme discomfort conditions, and their energy-saving intentions, then links these patterns with building design, workplace contextual factors, and demographics. A cross-sectional survey was collected among university employees from China, Brazil, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, and the US. Our results demonstrated that the accessibility to indoor environmental controls (IECs) and office type are the significant factors for adaptive strategies. There was a positive relationship between the number of IEC features and the percentage of employees choosing a technological solution. When feeling too hot, occupants in private offices are more likely to adopt a technological solution, whereas occupants in cubicles are more likely to choose a personal adjustment. Occupants with energy-saving intentions are less likely to choose thermostat adjustments or use portable devices as adaptive strategies than their counterparts. Finally, the cluster analysis suggests females were more likely to use adaptive strategies for energy-saving purposes than males. The majority of occupants would turn on/off lighting to save energy. The study provides the contributions in the connection between the heuristic decision-making process and energy-saving intentions and recommendations on design strategies for building architects, engineers, and managers. © 2021},

	abstract = {Utilizing waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies is becoming crucial in today's world where energy sources are scarce. Despite the fact that WtE technologies (incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery) have been analyzed thoroughly in the literature regarding their efficiency rates in treating waste, the applicability of each method to different waste compositions and in various economic environments has not been considered before. In this study, this issue is investigated by modeling and solving a mixed integer programming model. The model is illustrated in three settings, namely Turkey, Brazil, and Germany, each of which is an example of a lower middle income, upper middle income, and a high income country, respectively. The findings of the optimization model suggest that plasma-arc gasification and advanced incineration stand out as the most efficient technologies to create the WtE conversion, provided that there are sufficient funds to build and run these facilities. If there are economic restraints, anaerobic digestion could be a more cost-effective way to create energy from waste. However, the solutions can be highly dependent on the parameters of the problem, as indicated in the results of the sensitivity analysis performed. In particular, if CO2 emissions are a big concern, the optimization model favors more of plasma-arc and pyrolysis technologies. Novelty Statement: Despite a wide range of previous studies involving technical analysis of WtE technologies, an economic perspective involving facility building decisions comparing different income level countries has not been performed before. This study examines all waste-to-energy methods in the literature not only regarding their efficiency rates in treating waste but also selecting the most appropriate methodology in different settings. In this manner, considering different income level countries brings a proper perspective and novelty to the study. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Three different scenarios were simulated, and the results showed that it is possible to obtain about 2475 kWh/(m2/year) in energy savings, by replacing the current lighting system of fluorescent lamps with light-emitting diode (LED) lighting.

Presenting a solution to assist in the decision making of engineers, architects or building managers for the optimal arrangements’ choice for lighting and air conditioning equipment, considering each built environment and project profile. For the validation process, a basic building was created with 15 rooms spread over three floors, according to the most common construction parameters in the North of Brazil. First, different combinations of objective-function candidates were investigated to compose the multi-objective algorithm fitness function, analyzing its performance in two central scenarios: (1) adding some “baits” in air conditioning equipment files, and (2) without this inclusion. Thus, it was found that considering only three objective functions—incremental cost, energy consumption and the air conditioning energy efficiency coefficient—it is possible to get optimal non-dominated solutions in both scenarios, thus highlighting the robustness of the proposed methodology. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Energy benchmarking of buildings has an important role in improving energy performance by establishing a reference for the energy efficiency of the building stock. The simulation of archetypes followed by a generalisation model has been widely used to obtain benchmarks. However, even though archetypes summarise the main features of the building stock, the uncertainties must be accounted for in the modelling process. Moreover, testing the response of the benchmarking model using the actual building stock data supports the reliability of the method. This paper aims to propose an innovative framework to reduce the uncertainty of archetypes for benchmarking buildings. A standard framework for data compiling is proposed and an assessment of the uncertainty of variables using entropy and cluster analysis allowed to obtain representative archetypes. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used as a predictive tool, and it was applied to benchmark a sample of actual buildings. Also, the simulation outcomes were used to determine energy end-uses according to the climatic zones. The framework proposition is presented alongside with a practical application. The result is an unprecedented benchmarking model: the archetype considers more variation in parameters of the building stock with higher uncertainties. Additionally, the modelling process showed to be robust for combining different datasets, and the ANN achieved high-performance metrics. Conclusion indicates the potential of using the framework for other typologies. Moreover, the framework demonstration is used for a school stock in Brazil, showing a trend to the inefficiency while a specific case study was explored, showing the potential of the method to find faults in the building energy use. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Natural resources in the current scenario of energy production and consumption demands appropriate management. Due to increasing urbanization worldwide, energy consumption optimization has become fundamental, including in the building sector. Many authors mention bioclimatic architecture as an intelligent way to achieve energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption while providing thermal comfort for the users. This paper aims to evaluate the energetic performance of a bioclimatic pilot plant in Bioclimatic zone 2. The methodology to evaluate the energetic performance of the bioclimatic building was developed from hygrothermal measurements and simulations in eQUEST version 3.65. The building was compared to its similar nonbioclimatic one by changing its envelope characteristics in the simulation. The results show the efficiency of bioclimatic strategies, which ensures the building's thermal and hygrometric stability, besides thermal comfort conditions most of the time. Consequently, these strategies allow one to reduce about 25% of the electric energy consumption compared to the nonbioclimatic building.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The objective of this work is to present strategies related to lighting retrofit on a university in Brazil. Studies are being carried out to integrate existing systems with natural lighting and creating conditions for the implementation of NetZero energy buildings, in addition to replacing existing building lamps. The consumption reduction projection was up to 46.06% in the lighting system through the retrofit in the buildings presented, with prospects for improvement in lighting levels combined with a reduction in consumption. The campus public lighting was also retrofitted, in addition to these strategies. The university has been implemented strategies to reduce energy consumption, also improving the productivity and health conditions of the building’s users. By encouraging research through partnerships with manufacturers and the private sector, these practices can improve, expanding the strategies adopted for the built environment, contributing to the SDG7 of 2030 Agenda. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Parameters related to power, such as displacement, horsepower, torque and acceleration, impacted as well. Hybrids had positive effects, but its diffusion in Brazil is likely to be slow. Fuel economy could have been 20.9% to 23.4% higher in the period if all technological progress were expended on better fuel economy, as opposed to the 12.1% actually realized.

	abstract = {Occupant-centric building design and operation has attracted recent research efforts in many countries, as building occupants are being more recognized as the main drivers in planning and operating safe, comfortable, energy-efficient indoor environments. In this matter, the role of building managers and operators is crucial to capture the needs of occupants and to adapt the response of the building accordingly. IEA EBC Annex 79 participants conducted 72 interviews with operators and facility managers across 7 countries (Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, Poland, Singapore, and USA) covering a wide range of ASHRAE 169 climate zones (from 0 to 5 in the climate classification). This paper presents a qualitative cross-case analysis of operators’ perspectives and experiences to identify regional differences. Therefore, the analyses are based on the hypotheses that climate or other country-related aspects would be the main drivers of building operation procedures differences. Results show climatic differences have little influence on building management, while occupants' complaints are very influenced by them. Moreover, operators are lacking clear tools, like guidelines and standards, on how to optimize building management in a climatic-adaptive and occupant-centric manner. Therefore, the development of operation protocols for building sustainable operation respecting climatic context and occupants’ control is recommended. © 2022},

	abstract = {To increase the accuracy of energy efficiency interventions over a building's lifetime, it is essential to predict the impact of climate change. Studies have analyzed building performance under future environmental conditions in Brazil, but the influence of design variables in the whole thermal and energy performance is a topic that still needs to be addressed. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of climate change on the thermo-energetic performance of Brazilian low-income housing in the climates of two cities: Belém and São Paulo. For this, the research was based on computer simulations and Morris global sensitivity analysis, observing the influence of design variables in different periods. Weather files were generated to represent future environmental conditions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario. The results prove that building design must necessarily consider climate change for a resilient built environment and highlight the importance of design variables, especially in the São Paulo climate. In view of future higher temperatures, the sensitivity indices indicate that natural ventilation is crucial for building performance improvements, followed by solar absorptance of the envelope and thermal transmittance of the walls. Finally, this study contributes to design decision-making for low-income housing in tropical climates and underscores the need for investigation of how to design resilient buildings, focusing on strategies to mitigate climate change and reduce pollutant emissions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hybrid polygeneration systems offer a great opportunity to meet growing energy demands with cost efficiency and environmental benefits. The identification of the optimal solution (configuration and operational strategy) is strongly affected by the relationship between the system and its surroundings. Previous studies have analyzed the influence of boundary conditions on the synthesis of polygeneration systems for buildings. However, local regulations are often disregarded or oversimplified in those studies. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the influence of legal conditions on the integration of renewable energy technologies in polygeneration systems for buildings. A comprehensive synthesis model is developed, including different types of legal conditions, such as power exchange modalities, subsidies/surcharges on energy prices and investment costs, and total ban on fossil fuels. Then, the model is applied to the case study of a Brazilian hospital. The current Brazilian net metering scheme is implemented. Results show that natural gas cogeneration is an attractive solution to cover the hospital's energy demands with or without the possibility of selling/exporting electricity. Also, the Brazilian net metering scheme, by itself, is not enough to ensure renewable energy deployment. An in-depth discussion about the conditions that would promote renewable energy integration is reported and recommendations are made on how current policies can be improved, including the need to explicitly address renewable technologies, the application of minimum renewable fractions, and the role of renewable heat/cooling. While the case study considers the specific circumstances in Brazil, it provides insights that can be extended to other countries or applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The literature emphasises the important role that occupants play on the energy performance of buildings, and increasing knowledge of drivers for human-building interactions is required. However, innovative sensors or technology are not always available – especially in developing countries – and stakeholders from the building sector may struggle to reach meaningful outcomes. Therefore, we propose a low-cost framework to assess patterns of internal blind control that can be replied in different locations. It is a questionnaire-based evaluation, which infers self-reported patterns of behaviour, as well as non-physical parameters and building characteristics that influence internal blind adjustments. A case study applying the framework was conducted in Florianópolis, southern Brazil, and the results are presented. Three control patterns were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis, which provides valuable insights to estimate building energy consumption considering the influence of user behaviour in performance simulations. Also, Chi-square tests showed an association of building characteristics – solar orientation and distance between user and window – to the internal blind adjustments. This case study supports the role of user-centric design as by understanding drivers for occupant behaviour one may adapt buildings and systems to the needs or preferences of users. Along these lines, if typical patterns of behaviour, as well as main triggers for adjustments, are found, simulation-based evaluations may present to stakeholders the best options of blind properties (e.g., considering finishings or colours). Finally, this framework makes room to combine information found on field studies to published models and algorithms of internal blind control. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In the Brazilian context, a deep-rooted inefficient structure of energy management implies a lack of mapping the actual conditions of the public schools. Therefore, this paper aimed to assess the actual energy performance of school buildings in Brazil. This paper innovates by integrating questionnaire responses and billed energy data to allow the construction of an evidence-based stock model through a statistical approach, which was never performed for the Brazilian building stock. Moreover, the association of energy use intensity (EUI) with the core aspects of building characteristics, occupancy, environmental satisfaction and necessary improvements mapped the relevance of such aspects in energy usage patterns. Additionally, a discussion of the EUI indicators was addressed. Results showed an unprecedented broad panorama of the school building stock in Brazil and its main features. In terms of statistical analysis, the Weibull distribution was appropriate for representing the continuous variables of the stock. The EUI as a function of the number of students was more suitable than the floor-plan area to achieve a reliable energy performance analysis. Several tests were performed to assess if the energy management, environmental satisfaction and maintenance practices impacted the EUI or not. Finally, the main conclusion was that the stock model obtained was simple and fit the energy management structure in the Brazilian scenario. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In Brazil, the use of this technique is still incipient due to the lack of studies that demonstrate its viability in the country’s climatic conditions, as well as underground temperature and demand for acclimatization of buildings. The aim of the current work is to present a site characterization for the first geothermal energy investigation carried out in the Brazilian South region. This study is being conducted at the Geotechnical Experimental Site of the State University of Ponta Grossa, and this paper describes the physical, mineralogical, thermal and mechanical characteristics of this site, which comprises a thick layer of a lateritic sandy clay soil over a silty sand layer. The preliminary results of the ground temperatures are consistent with the common trends reported in the literature, showing more expressive oscillations near the ground surface, and becoming approximately constant at higher depths. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Mecanica dos Solos.

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate future energy benchmarks for the school building stock in Brazil, considering the gradual implementation of air-conditioning systems in those buildings and the influence of future climate conditions. Archetypes were simulated using EnergyPlus for four cities in Brazil, representing predominant weather data in the country. The models were simulated considering air-conditioning implementation in two scenarios: a) administrative and lab environments; b) administrative, labs and all classrooms. Modified-weather data considering IPCC scenario A2 was used to include climate change trends for 2050 and 2080. The average and standard deviation of Energy Use Intensity (EUI) were analysed. Results showed an increase of the average EUI of the school building stock in Brazil considering the air-conditioning implementation, raising 88% concerning the actual EUI if the systems were implemented today, 8% in 2050 and 43% in 2080. Conclusions support that upgrading thermal comfort conditions in those buildings require attention towards improving energy efficiency strategies. © International Building Performance Simulation Association, 2022},

	abstract = {The energy consumption in buildings accounts for a significant portion of energy production worldwide hence there is a growing interest in the development of more efficient projects. One way to achieve buildings with low energy consumption while maintaining a high thermal comfort is the Passive House concept. This paper discusses the alternative approach of the Passive House standard for hot climates. The certification refers to a low-energy building standard for cold climate regions that the indoor comfort conditions can be maintained year-round with a specific minimum energy consumption target. There cannot be a single Passive House concept since there are climatic variations. Thus, the Passive House Institute reviewed the proposal for the application of the standard to meet hot climate regions around the world. This study is located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and considered a residential project proposal for the city of Pelotas, Brazil.

	abstract = {This research focused on studies of the cross-laminated timber (CLT) construction system and, in particular, on an innovative panel composition of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis) heartwood, which is considered in Brazil as a low-added-value material that is often discarded or used for less noble purposes. The aim of this study was to investigate the thermo-energetic performance of CLT panels for use in low-income housing under several different climate conditions. The research was based on the simulation method of the Brazilian Technical Regulation of Quality for the Energy Efficiency Level of Residential Buildings (RTQ-R). The results, based on 72 parametric simulations, proved that CLT panels made of eucalyptus heartwood have significant potential for thermo-energetic improvement in various housing types under diverse climatic conditions. The simulated envelope combinations showed that in Curitiba (bioclimatic zone 1), it is important to associate 5-layered CLT panels with 10 cm thermal insulation; in São Paulo (bioclimatic zone 3), the envelope should be provided with low solar absorptance and 5-layered CLT panels without thermal insulation; and in Belém (bioclimatic zone 8), in addition to the low solar absorptance in the envelope, the CLT panels should be composed of only three layers and without thermal insulation. It was concluded that the innovative CLT construction system with low-added-value eucalyptus heartwood is a very promising technology for Brazilian dwellings that are more energy efficient, with further studies on mechanical behavior being necessary for its consolidation in the country. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The construction industry struggles in environmental and economic performance due to waste generation. Several studies have measured this waste in the construction industry of developing countries like India, Brazil, China, Nigeria and Iran, and proposed strategies to enhance the overall efficiency. But no such work exists in Pakistan's context. The construction industry of Pakistan contributes significantly to the country's gross domestic product (GDP). And with several mega projects in progress to overcome the energy crises and improve the infrastructure of the country, the absence of proper waste management policies and plans calls for empirical research. Therefore, this study quantifies and benchmarks material waste in the local context, its impact on project cost and the effect of multiple subcontracting arrangements on waste generation. It also proposes a conceptual waste management plan (WMP) for local conditions which can be generalized for developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a mixed research approach by leveraging Saunders's research onion model. To benchmark the current wastage practices, quantitative data of material waste in the Pakistani construction industry are gathered through document review of accounting systems, inventory and payment records of 40 completed building projects. Using the data, the waste rate of different materials is measured along with their impact on cost. Additionally, the role of subcontracting arrangements in waste generation is also investigated. Also, semi-structured interviews are conducted with project managers of high- and low-performing construction organizations to propose a conceptual WMP for the local industry and developing countries. Findings: The highest wasteful materials by quantity are wood, sand and concrete blocks, and those by cost are wood, bricks and steel. By quantity, 123% more material was used on average than the actual productive work. Also, the labor only (L-O) subcontracting arrangement causes maximum waste. Moreover, the difference between the highest (155%) and lowest wasting company (104%) is 51%, highlighting the proactive and resistive waste management culture and approach by the worst- and best-performing companies. Further, the impact of waste quantities is more than 2% of the project cost. Finally, a conceptual model consisting of measures at the project, industry and national levels is also proposed as a guide for developing countries. Practical implications: The findings of this benchmarking study can help improve the project planning, execution and monitoring, and control practices by providing a better understanding of the material waste potential. This will help economize the construction industry and improve its sustainability. Originality/value: This is the first benchmarking study that quantitatively measures material waste in the construction industry of Pakistan. It highlights that costly as well as sustainability-implicating materials are frequently wasted in the local construction projects. Also, this study correlates the wastage with subcontracting arrangements. Additionally, an original conceptual WMP is proposed that could help the industry improve its performance. The findings could help the construction professionals identify the loopholes in their material management practices and not only save money but also ensure better sustainability. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Currently, a new building with GEPs is under construction at the University of São Paulo campus in São Paulo City, Brazil. Part of the building loads will be supported by steel pipe piles equipped with single U-type absorber pipes for heat exchange. To find the optimum solution of pile backfill material in terms of cost, constructability, sustainability and thermal performance, field thermal response tests were conducted on 4 instrumented piles filled with different materials: water, saturated sand, grout, and steel fiber grout. Both analytical and numerical models were used to evaluate the tested alternatives. The results showed that the thermal performance of the 4 piles is similar; however, the costs and sustainability aspects (low CO2 emissions) of the solutions using water or saturated sand imply that they are more advantageous than those using grout. Additionally, the experiments showed that for the pile backfilled with water the convection effects have improved the heat transfer to the soil. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Having this in mind, they partnered up with PUC-Rio to establish a new DT initiative. [Goal] The goal of this paper is to present the Lean R&D approach, tailored within the new initiative to meet the aforementioned DT needs. [Method] We designed Lean R&D integrating the following building blocks: (i) Lean Inceptions, to allow stakeholders to jointly outline a Minimal Viable Product (MVP); (ii) parallel technical feasibility assessment and conception phases, allowing to 'fail fast'; (iii) scrum-based development management; and (iv) strategically aligned continuous experimentation to test business hypotheses. We report on first experiences of applying Lean R&D in practice. [Results] Lean R&D enabled addressing research-related uncertainties early and to efficiently deliver valuable MVPs within fast-paced four months cycles. [Conclusions] In our first experiences Lean R&D showed itself suitable for supporting DT initiatives. However, more formal case studies are needed. The business strategy alignment and the continuous support of a highly qualified research team were considered key success factors.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Knowing water and energy consumption patterns sets the baseline for understanding their drivers and assessing the performance of potential measures to increase efficiency and/or reliability. These patterns can vary substantially depending on the building characteristics, on the building users and use, on the cultural, social, economic, environmental context in which the building is located, among many other factors. This article presents a general methodological framework for characterizing water and energy consumption patterns in buildings based on the evaluation of the characteristics of the equipments and appliances, as well as the type of users and the activities developed in each type of room. This allows estimating water and energy use, by end use per square meter and by roomtype. The methodological framework proposed was applied to the buildings of the Paricarana Campus of Federal University of Roraima (UFRR), Brazil, providing one of the few examples in the literature reporting water and energy consumption in university buildings in tropical climates. Universities, in most cases, represent large water and energy consumers with distinctive consumption drivers and patterns which have received limited attention when compared to other types of buildings (e.g., residential). The findings have shown that teaching rooms and administration rooms are the main consumers, representing 48% and 49% of the institution's energy and water consumption, respectively. Air conditioning is the biggest energy consumption (63%), while personal use represents 72% of the total water consumption in a building. The toilets represent a large water consumption in a university building (46.40%). Comparing different building uses, the central library is the highest consumer, due to the longest operating time and the highest occupational density. The methodological proposal intends to be a useful tool to support managers and decision-makers to understand the dynamics of consumption and then propose effective practices to reduce water and energy uses, as well as providing reference data for comparison with other educational institutions. © 2021 The Author(s)},

In this research, it is hypothesized that a group of PCMs in the narrow range can be used for the whole tropical savanna climate according to Koppen-Geiger climate classification. Eight representative cities (Bamako, Bangalore, Bangkok, Brasilia, Dar es Salaam, Kolkata, Maputo and Surabaya) from seven different countries (Mali, Thailand, Brazil, Tanzania, India, Mozambique and Indonesia) were chosen in accordance with their demographical and economical state. Numerical simulations were performed in DesignBuilder software to carry out detailed investigation about thermal behavior and energy performance of a residential building integrated with eleven different PCMs (PCM21-PCM31). In addition, the impact of PCM thickness, its location in the wall (external, middle, and internal) and different surface area were assessed. Results of thermal performance during a summer day revealed that temperature fluctuations in PCM integrated building dropped by up to 2.76 °C even when the HVAC system was switched off. From energy analysis, the hypothesis of this research was confirmed, and the narrow range of PCMs (PCM25-PCM29) were found to be optimum for this climate zone. Considerable energy savings and energy consumption reduction up to 68.63% was obtained. Furthermore, for constant volume, the thinner PCM layer with greater surface area exhibited superior performance in terms of energy savings. Hence, the incorporation of PCM in buildings located in a tropical savanna climate is feasible. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Modern Movement in architecture was a key player in the post-war construction of many countries around the world, having diverse facets that can be seen from Chicago’s skyscrapers to Brazil with the construction of Brasilia. In a Spanish scenario, it is possible to find some unequal examples of preserved architectural heritage that present distinctive curtain walls. The Barcelona “Trade Buildings” (1966-1971) are a great example of those glazed volumes. Although many modern glazed façade buildings age relatively well, the current environmental requirements are way far from the initial ones, configured during the 50´, ´60s or ´70s. It is thus undeniable that most of those buildings require energy refurbishment as soon as possible to keep operating in the sustainable environment we are trying to accomplish. In order to determine an analysis methodology for refurbishing the glazed buildings of the modern heritage, this study aims to evaluate a building through its energetic aspects and establish refurbishment strategies that contribute to more sustainable development, always respecting the historical and architectural value of the cities. By using the Barcelona “Trade Buildings” as a case study, this research surveys problems related to the lack of energy efficiency in the building. An intervention of this nature must identify the current conditions of the building, analyzing its energy and comfort requirements to finally propose energy-efficient and heritage-friendly solutions for the project. The three main responsible aspects that can influence in the energy consumption are, first of all, the users, who usually are responsible for energy wasting, the external building envelope, which is that factor that determines the energetic demand, and the mechanical systems, that must provide the appropriate habitability and comfort conditions. The analysis method has been carried out by developing an energetic survey through data of consumption and energy simulation programs. The results of the performance of the building materiality and systems obtained were used to propose improvement measures for the building based on Nearly Zero1 and circular economy concepts1, through the development of isolation strategies and shading mechanisms. Among the objectives of this research, we have imposed the preservation of the modern exterior image devised by Modernism, extending and improving the building’s lifetime, implementing comfort conditions in accordance with current habitability requirements. In addition to this, in the long term, it is assumed that the building will have a sustainable character, by reducing the energy costs and carbon emissions originally generated. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {As scientific research shows a progressive increase in Earth temperature, climate change is recognized as a key global challenge for the 21st century. Studying the consequences of this phenomenon has gained worldwide importance, including in the field of buildings. It starts from the problematic that comes from the housing models that, at present, are already built with inadequate thermal insulation, questioning what internal conditions will bring benefits in these future heating scenarios. In places with hot climates such as in the Brazilian savannah, this subject is even more important because an effective countermeasure is necessary in reducing the cooling load of buildings. High temperatures lead to longer demand for air conditioning, which results in a significant increase in building energy consumption. In this way, this work has the general objective to analyze the effects of global warming on the consumption of buildings with different insulation in the envelope, in face of the climatic changes. The emissions scenario A2 of the Fourth Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was considered. The methodological procedures consist of five steps: preparation of the climate files for Future Scenarios (time-slices 2020, 2050 and 2080) from the file without influence of global warming (1961-1990), called Base Scenario; definition of a dwelling for study object (Tbase); quantification of global warming impacts on building consumption; elaboration of intervention proposals in the object of study, defining four typologies (Tbase and T1 to T3) by adopting the use of insulation, in the first one (T1) was applied EPS, in the second (T2) rockwool and in the third (T3) glasswool, in the last stage, the energy consumption for cooling was estimated, considering the main facade as north for all cases. Under the effects of global warming, the results showed the annual average temperature and relative humidity of the external air of the Base Scenario from 26.73 ° C to 32.48 ° C (+ 5.75 ° C) and 69.08% to 53.67% (-22%), up to the 2080 scenario, respectively. Energy consumption is directly influenced by the effects of global warming, Tbase's energy consumption in the current scenario presents increases for the 2080 scenario of 54.18%, the T1 was 40.73%, the T2 of 41.97% and the T3 ratio of 41.87%. With the use of insulation in the typologies T1 to T3, the energy consumption reduced in the base scenario by 30.58%, 30.62% and 30.64% respectively. This fact proves the importance and effectiveness of the use of more resilient envelopes as a strategy to mitigate climate change. It is concluded that considering the useful life of 50-year-old buildings, it is necessary to re-think the current constructive specifications, incorporating interventions to absorb the impacts of climate change, pointing out guidelines on how to build today, to provide better and more resilient climate habitability in future climate scenarios. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This paper presents the method used by Maciel and Carvalho (2019) [1], that investigated the energy benefit of opaque ventilated façades compared to cladding façades in multi-floor residential buildings in Brazil. The authors divided the methodology in four parts: ensure the gap of investigation through a systematic mapping of literature (SML), verify the best software´s BIM and BES, in terms of interoperability, performed several simulations during a hole year for 09 different climate regions, and validated the collected data with a statistic tool. In the SML few studies were found on the topic discussed, and only two performed comparisons between different climates, both used computer simulation. The bibliographic revision about interoperability showed that the most comprehensive BES software´s to use with a BIM model were IES-VE and GBS, being chosen the GBS. All configuration to the simulation were made following instructions of international regulations. The collected data was validated by Tukey test. Although the steps of the methodology were not original, the authors certified along the process that the choices made were the most efficient and valid ones. • With this methodology, it was possible to gain great agility in data being generated, which enables a broad sample and a several possibilities of analyses. • The statistical processing of data enables trust in the results found with the computer simulations. © 2021},

	abstract = {The shape and orientation of a building influence the energy demand, therefore optimal decisions should only be made rigorously supported by energy evaluation programs, which allow for measuring the energy demand of a building more precisely. The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the shape and orientation of massive residential social housing multifamily buildings to find the best solar positioning to minimize cooling and heating demands simultaneously in the bioclimatic zone 2 (Cfa) in the southern region of Brazil. To do this, this study utilizes multi-objective optimization with a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) simulating the thermal behavior in EnergyPlus and performing the optimization with a Python language programming code, totalizing 80,000 simulations. The main results showed that solar orientation optimization could reduce the total demand by 4% for the “H” shape and 22% for linear buildings in the isolated scenario. For the condominium condition, the reduction is 2% for the “H” typology and 8% for the linear shape. The results presented can help engineers and architects to design more energy-efficient buildings and address the energetic vulnerability in the same building. Moreover, future work can be carried out to improve the constructive pattern replicated all over the country, improving the surroundings. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Economy and parsimony in the consumption of energy resources are becoming a part of common sense in practically all countries, although the effective implementation of energy efficiency policies still has a long way to go. The energy demand for residential buildings is one of the most significant energy sinks. We focus our analysis on one of the most energy-consuming systems of residential buildings located in regions of tropical climate, which are cooling systems. We evaluate to which degree the integration of thermal energy storage (TES) and photovoltaic (PV) systems helps to approach an annual net zero energy building (NZEB) configuration, aiming to find a feasible solution in the direction of energy efficiency in buildings. To conduct the simulations, an Energy Efficiency Analysis Framework (EEAF) is proposed. A literature review unveiled a potential knowledge gap about the optimization of the ASHRAE operational modes (full storage load, load leveled, and demand limiting) for air conditioning/TES sets using PV connected to the grid. A hy-pothetical building was configured with detailed loads and occupation profiles to simulate different configurations of air conditioning associated with TES and a PV array. Using TRNSYS software, a set of scenarios was simulated, and their outputs are analyzed in a life cycle perspective using life cycle costing (LCC). The modeling and simulation of different scenarios allowed for identifying the most economic configurations from a life cycle perspective, within a safe range of operability considering the energy efficiency and consequently the sustainability aspects of the buildings. The EEAF also supports other profiles, such as those in which the occupancy of residential buildings during the day is increased due to significant changes in people’s habits, when working and studying in home office mode, for example. These changes in habits should bring a growing interest in the adoption of solar energy for real-time use in residential buildings. The results can be used as premises for the initial design or planning retrofits of buildings, aiming at the annual net zero energy balance. © 2021 by the authors.

By the end of 2020, Data Centers will grow 53% worldwide. There are methodologies that measure the efficiency of energy consumption. The most used metric is the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) index, but it does not fully reflect efficiency. Three DC’s located at the cities of Curitiba, Londrina and Iguaçu Falls (Brazil) with close PUE values, are evaluated in this article using the Energy Usage Effectiveness Design (EUED) index as an alternative to the current method. EUED uses energy as a comparative element in the design phase. Infrastructure consumption is the sum of energy with Heating, Ventilating and Air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, equipment, lighting and others. The EUED values obtained were 1.245 (kWh/yr)/(kWh/yr), 1.313 (kWh/yr)/(kWh/yr) and 1.316 (kWh/yr)/(kWh/yr) to Curitiba, Londrina and Iguaçu Falls, respectively. The difference between the EUED and the PUE Constant External Air Temperature (COA) is 16.87% for Curitiba, 13.33% for Londrina and 13.30% for Iguaçu Falls. The new Perfect Design Data center (PDD) index prioritizes efficiency in increasing order is an easy index to interpret.

However, railways still struggle to take larger shares of the growing total transport volumes especially in developing countries, where priority tends to be given to doubling tracks parallel to the existing infrastructure instead of building entirely new optimized alignments. In this context, this paper discusses the lifespan impacts of these two strategies on a real case study in Brazil. We compared the doubling costs of tracks parallel to an existing route and the respective construction costs of 100 new optimized alignments, and the fuel and CO2-equivalent costs of four pollutants of trains running in 20 services over a timespan. Results show that the CO2-equivalent costs are significantly lower in the optimized alignments. Scenarios varying the yearly Brazilian economic growth and different monetary CO2-equivalent values show that 111 and 16 years are required to fuel and emissions compensate for the greater construction costs of the optimized alignments in the respective scenarios of average 1.2% and 4.6% economic growth over the years and CO2-equivalent values of USD21.9/tonCO2 and USD944.5/tonCO2. © 2022 The Authors},

In this way, the paper presents optimization algorithms coupled to a software with a capability to precisely simulate solar radiation availability by using a graphical pixel counting technique and by integrating with external models via Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). The optimization is based on mono-and multi-objective algorithms to solve a case study problem with two objectives to optimize: i) the cooling energy demand and ii) the payback period. Then, an economic viability model is presented, considering construction aspects such as insulation thickness, energy consumption and the number of installed solar panels. The algorithms are applied and compared for a building based on the BESTEST 910 case, considering tropical weather of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Both algorithms succeed, but with different characteristics related to computer run time and accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

	abstract = {There are two approaches to the issue of energy demand in buildings: generating more energy in a clean and renewable way or reducing the energy consumption of buildings through energy efficiency strategies. The question addressed by the article is how far to go with energy conservation and cost-effective measures. In this context, the general objective is to compare energy consumption and photovoltaic generation distributed in single-family homes of interest, through the cost-benefit ratio. 576 models were evaluated and the economic evaluation made for the model with the highest efficiency and the model with the lowest cost. The assessment was carried out using the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the payback. NPV has not proved to be profitable to efficiency strategies in three scenarios. The only scenario with positive NPV was the scenario in which the interest rate is low and the increase in energy is high. In the case of the photovoltaic system, only one scenario did not demonstrate viability, the scenario with high-interest rates, and a low increase in the price of energy. The same applies to the IRR. With this research it is concluded that, when treated as competitors from the financial point of view, the photovoltaic system presents a better performance in the indicators, being the most convenient for isolated application. Answering the question raised and showing the possibility of cost benefit for a massive implementation of renewable, financially viable clean energy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Social housing (SH) development is, in general, triggered by policies and regulations, which stimulate interventions, create financing mechanisms, and designate agents conducive to retrofit processes. European directives for energy efficiency and the recent call for a 'retrofit wave' have an evident influence. In Brazil, delivery and management of SH are based on the public offer of housing units and their immediate ownership transfer. National or state housing agencies are responsible for basic maintenance for five years, but other post-delivery interventions depend exclusively on the effort and expenses of the occupant. SH budgets leave little or no margin for extra spending and bringing SH to international sustainability standards is yet not mandatory. The issues that arise to implement upgrading in this context are therefore related to the following questions: What are the priority actions in upgrading processes? What type of financing would be required or is available? What is the project execution model and who are the stakeholders involved? This article focuses on the issue of prioritization of actions for upgrading SH. A systematic literature review examined reported sustainability-related housing improvements. A critical review of a Brazilian building label and two international sustainability assessment methods then supported ranking the upgrading actions according to the relevance assigned in their respective contexts. Finally, a panel of construction professionals provided insights regarding the technical feasibility and intrusiveness of their implementation in both single- and multi-family SH projects. Findings show that minor upgrading actions, such as changing hydraulic or electrical fixtures or landscaping, usually do not cost more than implementing them from the outcome and are equally applicable to single- and multi-family SH projects. But, when high-level (deep upgrading) interventions are on the table, costs rapidly increase due to the need to substantially change existing systems or supporting structures, which makes them often financially and/or technically unfeasible. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

These numbers continue to grow, despite significant efforts made by the government to promote the adoption of building energy efficiency (BEE) technologies, which have not been widely adopted due to barriers. A systematic literature review revealed 27 barriers, classified into six categories, as being responsible for hindering the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. This article aims to verify whether such barriers make sense in the Brazilian context. In order to accomplish this goal, a survey among one thousand Brazilian professionals was carried out. The results are analysed by two multivariate techniques, cluster and factor analysis, validating these barriers as well as the proposed taxonomy for Brazil. The results also show that the two most important categories of barriers are Governmental/Political/Regulatory and Financial/Economic, showing that Brazilian society has high expectations that the government will be more active in this matter. In addition, the survey respondents gave insights into important points concerning technology, education, etc. that should be verified in a timely manner. These findings can assist government agencies, researchers, and experts to develop guidelines/strategies to overcome such barriers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A novel methodology is proposed for the synthesis of polygeneration systems in tertiary sector buildings with detailed thermal integration. The methodology involves a systematic approach that combines Pinch Analysis, mathematical programming, and the definition of a superstructure with thermal flexibility whereby mass flows can exchange heat in various temperature intervals. With the detailed characterization of the thermal energy flows associated with the thermal energy technologies and services to be supplied to the building, the optimization procedure provides a more realistic system configuration, ensures that thermodynamic principles are satisfied, and allows for synergies and potential benefits to emerge. The methodology is first introduced through a simple example of a gas engine-based energy system, highlighting the necessity of a detailed characterization of the hot and cold flows regarding their quantity and quality levels. Then, the approach is applied to the case study of a Brazilian university hospital that requires electricity, steam, hot water, and chilled water. The optimization is formulated as a multi-period mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the total annual cost of installing and operating the system using local-based data. The results show the technical and economic interest of deploying cogeneration gas engines to cover electricity and thermal energy services. Besides, a strong synergy is observed between the cogeneration gas engine and the single-effect absorption chiller. Thus, it is demonstrated how a preliminary analysis of thermal integration opportunities must be an integral part of the optimal synthesis of energy supply systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

An online survey was applied to consumers who wanted to buy a house, aiming to understand their position regarding sustainability, and the role of the state versus the individual role, among other issues. The aim of the study is to identify consumer's perception of energy efficiency and sustainability to promote a future research agenda in the Latin American context. In general, consumers value sustainability, except when they are presented in opposition to economic growth and social protection. However, it is possible to identify differences between Chile, with an established neoliberal economy, and countries that have economies in transition. Indeed, Argentina and Brazil show differences in terms of the role of the State, or the thermal comfort, which is considered a matter of habits rather than a mere technological problem. For driving more sustainable behaviours, consumers should be engaged in the implementation of these standards, creating a twofold process including homebuyers on one hand and mandatory requirements on the other. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The efficient transformation of lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars is essential for building bioeconomies. Sugarcane is an important agricultural crop in a number of Latin American countries, including Brazil and Argentina. Herein culms from two different sugarcane (SC384 and SC724) and two energy cane varieties (EC3116 and EC3118) bred in Argentina were evaluated for sustainable production of second-generation biofuels and green chemicals. Changes in the biomass crystallinity, structure, and morphology introduced by pretreatments were investigated using X-ray diffraction (DRX), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Enzymatic hydrolysis yields of untreated and pretreated sugarcane and energy cane culms were determined and correlated with physical analyses and chemical composition characterizations. Overall, after combined acid and alkali pretreatment, enzymatic convertibility was highly efficient for all studied sugarcane and energy cane varieties, reaching over 97% of theoretical conversion yields. High crystallinity indices and crystallite sizes of pretreated culms and SEM results and CLSM were consistent with the removal of lignin, solubilization of hemicellulose, and amorphous parts of lignocellulose imprinted by the pretreatments. High potential of culms from sugarcane and energy cane varieties cultivated in Argentina for sustainable production of renewable lignocellulosic sugars and their transformation into green chemicals and fuels was demonstrated.

	abstract = {The high amount of energy consumption demanded by buildings entails the worsening of several environmental issues. Therefore, actions to make use of this resource more efficient become necessary. The most used methods of Building Energy Modeling (BEM) designated to assess the functionality of such actions are excessively complex and, in many cases, generate unreliable results. Thus, this work aims to elaborate an approach based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) to improve energy efficiency in buildings in a simplified and user-oriented manner. For this purpose, a case study was developed in which two classrooms of an educational building, located in the Amazon region – Brazil, were subjected to three-dimensional modeling and energy simulations in BIM software. In addition to evaluating the classrooms’ current performance regarding daylight, thermal conditions and energy consumption, such simulations intended to assess the implantation of two strategies that sought to reduce energy consumption and maintain thermal and visual comfort by taking advantage of daylight and natural ventilation. Besides of energy saving, such strategies were chosen as they promote Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and help to mitigate the indoor transmission of infectious agents, which is fundamental due to the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, especially in educational environments. The results showed that the strategy based on daylight contribution generated energy savings of around 8% for one of the rooms, and 12% for the other, while the one that exploited the use of natural ventilation was able to reduce energy consumption by about 7% for one of the rooms, and 9% for the other. Therefore, this research presents an important contribution as it provides an intelligible workflow that makes the energy simulation process friendlier and more intuitive and that was able to generate plausible results using BIM-BEM interoperability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In most underdeveloped countries the lack of access to constructive and consumption data makes it difficult to create a system for the energy consumption classification of buildings. As benchmarking is an important tool for comparing the energy consumption of a building to reference values this study aimed to develop a methodology for the establishment of a benchmark of the electric energy consumption of office buildings in mild temperate climates in which office buildings can operate a significant part of the year using natural ventilation as the air conditioning mode. The city of Belo Horizonte – Brazil was used as a study case. This study was carried out in three steps: Step 1: as data is not readily available it was necessary to establish of a database and a methodology to treat data; Step 2: elaboration of a methodology to create the benchmarking scale using available data; Step 3: analysis of energy efficiency ratings and the proposal of a rating system based on a logarithmic scale. The results of this study showed that it was possible to create a classification range with a 81% degree of reliability for the selected building typologies. In addition, the creation of different classifications according to the type of air conditioning mode made it possible to evaluate office building towers with similar characteristics. The scales proposed also show that for a mild climate, mixed air conditioning mode is a decisive feature in promoting energy efficiency and sustainability to buildings indicating that this strategy should be seriously considered in enforcement building laws. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The misuse of high-power electrical appliances such as air conditioners in both commercial and residential buildings has contributed to the inefficient use of energy resources. To face this scenario, smart buildings focus on minimizing energy consumption while improving the experience and productivity of users in these environments. Aiming at optimizing the use of air conditioners towards energy efficiency, this work presents Smart Place, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based ambient management system for automatically controlling those equipments. In this system, sensors and video cameras collect data regarding temperature, humidity, and presence of people in monitored spaces. These data are parameters for performing interventions on air conditioners in order to avoid keeping them turned on when the environment is not being used. The system also provides a Web interface for managing devices and monitored environments as well as it is integrated to the FIWARE platform as underlying middleware. This paper describes Smart Place, its architecture, and its operation at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Natal, Brazil. The paper also discusses the benefits resulted from the automatic intervention performed by Smart Place, which has been able to save 61.8% in energy consumption compared to the traditional manual control in a set of classrooms. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Dwellings with no heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are commonly found in many countries. The long-term thermal performance of these buildings can be assessed based on hourly data of occupant thermal discomfort integrated over the required timespan (e.g. total degree hours of discomfort per year). This approach can be easily applied when simulation is adopted in the assessment, but field studies using this approach are rare as they would require complex, costly and long measurement/survey campaigns. This paper addresses the challenges on conducting field studies on long-term thermal performance of dwellings with no HVAC system by introducing a novel performance indicator: the Seasonal Thermal Sensation Vote (S-TSV). S-TSV adopts the standard 7-point thermal sensation scale and is based on the perceived overall thermal sensation recalled by the user of the building for specific seasons and times of day. The new performance indicator is not intended to replace existing ones, but to complement them in the understanding of the complex thermal performance processes taking place in buildings with no HVAC. S-TSV was applied in a field study targeting a small sample of dwellings in Brazil. Results demonstrate the capabilities of S-TSV to describe trends in buildings performance in this sample. S-TSV also assisted on the identification of relationships between such performance and some independent variables addressed in this field study (e.g. windows operation, footwear and income), considering a threshold of p-values <0.05 on the chi-square statistic test. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to overcome this difficulty this study develops a comprehensive framework to identify and analyse the energy saving potential of an existing building stock category. The methodology consists of six basic steps: a process for defining reference buildings, dynamic archetype model simulations, an energy consumption baseline estimation, energy retrofit measures selection and a cost optimal pathway analysis, development of energy saving scenarios and estimation of building stock energy savings potential. In order to apply the proposed methodology, a case study of the high-rise office building stock took place in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The energy consumption projection results for the next 20 years show that there are significant opportunities for energy efficiency improvements. Cost effective energy savings of up to 24% would be possible in the high-rise office building stock. Overall, energy saving scenario projections emphasize the urgency of dealing with the existing high-rise office building stock but also highlight that to reduce the energy consumption of the current building stock the policy makers should pay close attention to the new buildings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The growing demand for electricity resulted from the continuous technical progress and its disturbing impacts on the environment motivate the search for technological alternatives for sustainable energy generation. The power consumption changes from consumer to consumer and depends on the nature of the activity it performs. In general, activities of trade and industry consume more energy during business hours while residential buildings do at dusk and at night. With the exception of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, period of greatest consumption of electricity in Rio de Janeiro is between 17h30 and 20h30. In summer months, the intensive use of air conditioning anticipates peak hours for 14h00. When technically possible, the use of photovoltaic conversion in these peak times, therefore, constitutes a smart strategy for load shifting the peak hours to off-peak for large consumers with contract demand in medium and high voltage. This alternative has two impacts: it relieves the systems at peak times and allows the utility to defer investments in their installed infrastructure. This paper, while discussing the technical conditions and the benefits of using photovoltaic systems in Brazil, proposes a method to identify, based on local solarimetric conditions, the photovoltaic conversion potential users. © 2015, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

These properties are important for the determination of Solar Reflectance Index, SRI, that may help designers and consumers to choose the appropriate materials to make their buildings more energy efficient and comfortable. The SRI indicates the ability of a surface to reflect solar radiation and mitigate the temperature rise of surfaces, being used in LEED certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) to evaluate the performance of some opaque elements in constructions. The studies revealed a wide variation of SRI (values are between 72 and 22) in the same product with different colors. In particular two samples showed SRI lower than 29, which place them even below the minimum requirement of LEED for application in some types of outside surfaces, as steep roofs and pavement materials (LEED v. 2009 used in Brazil). © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In Brazil, the standards for thermal performance of buildings, and the certifications to evaluate building energy efficiency are based on thermal comfort indexes, whose recommendations are obtained from climatic data of the Climatological Normals of the period 1961-1990. Between 1990 until today, the country underwent major transformations in its territory, such as the reduction of forest area, advancement of the agricultural area, expansion and densification of urban centres. All these factors may have affected the macro, meso and microclimate. Thus, data for the period 1961-90 may not reflect the current climate and the condition of acclimatization of populations. The purpose of this research is to analyse the most current climatic data, aiming to assess whether or not there are changes in the climate that affect comfort, as well as verify the pertinence of the current recommendations for thermal performance. The selected data for analysis are air temperature and humidity for the period 1985-2015, provided by the National Institute of Meteorology. The methodology uses descriptive statistics to determine the trends and variability for behavioural assessment of climate change. Subsequently, building design strategies of different comfort indexes, such as Givoni, Mahoney are revised regarding the new climate data, as well as, the changes in neutral temperature and degree-days. Then, spatial distribution of the results is present in thematic maps, thus one can assess the regional trends inside Brazilian areas. As a result, the mean temperature of cities had increased all over Brazil, which causes changes in the recommendations for thermal performance. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.},

This paper aims to analyze the differences between the electric energy consumption prediction of a call center building located in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, using (a) a schedule based on routines provided by the air conditioning designer made in order to establish the system loads and to define the system equipment and (b) a schedule based in the employee's routines provided by the owners of the building. First, the simulation results were compared to the mean measured building energy consumption and, differently from the first schedule, when the second schedule was used, a Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE) of 5% was met which is considered a prediction acceptable by the ASHRAE Guideline 14-2002 [Measurement of Energy and Demand Savings (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers, 2002)]. Afterwards, it was verified how the two occupation schedules influenced the building classification according to the Brazilian Governmental Building Energy Efficiency Labeling. In this case, the two different schedules resulted in a difference in electric energy consumption of 10.9%, leading to a difference of one level in the classification. This fact clearly demonstrates the importance of a correct definition of occupation and equipment usage in the energy performance prediction of a building. © 2018 Author(s).},

New houses built in response to this demand should seek to deliver thermal comfort and energy efficiency to their occupants. In this paper, the authors use a low-income housing typology designed for the climate of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil as a vehicle to explore ways of optimising the building envelope to improve thermal performance passively. The concept of fabric first approach is explored, varying the levels of insulation and airtightness of the envelope as means of improving indoor environmental conditions and energy savings. The method used was dynamic building simulations, underpinned by empirical data and assessed for its thermal/energy efficiency and construction cost. The findings suggested that an optimised envelope can achieve an increase of the thermal comfort of up to 130%, and a reduction of the energy demand to negligible levels. The results demonstrated, however, that the envelope optimisation increased costs considerably. The results also suggested that there is a need for further investigation of infiltration levels in residential buildings in Brazil and their implications on the delivery of thermal comfort. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.},

	abstract = {We measured air temperature at 14 sites with different land cover composition within the urban canopy layer of a mid-sized Brazilian city. The intensity (ΔT) of the urban heat island (UHI) was calculated using data collected above a lake and at an urban park as references. We investigated the spatio-temporal variability of ΔT during four contiguous days with varying weather. The first day was overcast and rainy, giving rise to a moderate UHI. The second day was sunny, which caused the diurnal ΔT fields to become heterogeneous, due to larger heating rates at sites with more man-made surfaces compared to natural surfaces. A high-pressure system observed on the last days brought cloudless skies, causing smaller ΔT during the day and greater at night. We hypothesise that the effect was due to the reduction of cooling via evapotranspiration caused by closing of the stomata as the soil dried out, which reduced the daytime temperature differences among the sites. The night-time effect was caused by stronger radiative cooling due to clear skies. The temperature within the park was always lower than over the lake, confirming that urban forestry is a more effective mechanism to combat the UHI. Introducing a park would be about sevenfold cheaper than building a city pond. Hence, green spaces are not only more efficient to combat the UHI but it is also a cheaper strategy compared to blue spaces. Moreover, vegetation delivers other benefits, such as removal of air pollutants, attenuation of urban noise, improvement of city aesthetic and their use as recreational spaces. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

Water absorption values after 90 days of cure varied between 8.9 and 15.1% and water resistance coefficient reached 1.17. They can be used for the production of construction materials such as tiles, bricks, and blocks, as road base and airfield runways, dam cores, industrial and municipal waste dumps bases, building foundations. The studies of the developed material, by the methods of XRD, AAS, SEM, EDS, DTA - DTG, tomographic mapping of the chemical elements and isotopic composition (LAMMA), demonstrated the synthesis of new formations, mainly amorphous, with small inclusions of crystalline structures. Results of leaching and solubility tests by the AAS method showed the full ecological compatibility of the developed materials with the environmental standards of Brazil. © 2019},

	abstract = {One of the most important tools to compare many consumers’ energy use intensity (EUI) is the specific consumption index. It is calculated by dividing the used energy by a factor that can explain energy variations. In Brazil, this index is often calculated by means of establishing the number of students as the responsible factor to explain the energy variation among schools. However, when their figures are compared, it can be verified that small schools have a high index. This occurs because either the construction of this index is as a whole based on one single factor or this factor is not sufficient or adequate to elucidate the energy variation. From the same data used at present, it is possible to improve the index by applying the methodology proposed in this article. Likewise, it is possible to enhance the index by using more factors that sufficiently explain the energy variations. Two different cases have been analysed and their results using the new methodology attested the benefits of its application. Even employing the same data, the new index has proven to be more complete and it is easy to apply. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {It is known that building performance usually involves different criteria such as the energy consumption, thermal comfort, thermal loads and internal temperatures, which can make its assessment more complex. Thus, this paper aims to describe a decision-making process to improve some criteria related to the energy efficiency of residential buildings considering a multicriteria approach. Computer simulation using EnergyPlus v8.3-2014 was performed to assess the thermal and energy performance of a residential building for four different climates in Brazil (Belém, Campo Grande, Curitiba and Florianópolis). The performance criteria were the degree-hours and energy consumption for air-conditioning (both for heating and cooling) in different decision makers’ preference scenarios. The performances of eight constructive systems were evaluated considering uncertainties related to the operational variables of the building, obtained through field survey. The results showed that some systems had statistically equivalent performance considering the range of uncertainty. The system of masonry with double massive brickwork performed better for three climates; for Belém, however, an adequate system highly depends on the preference scenario. Nonetheless, different preference scenarios would indicate different adequate systems for all climates. This study used a method of decision-making which enables the possibility for future analyses of other performance alternatives, design variables, and performance criteria. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {One of the alternatives to reduce building energy consumption recognized and used internationally is establishing standards for the evaluation and classification of buildings in terms of energy performance. In developed countries, the introduction of energy efficiency codes for residential and non-residential buildings started around the time of the first oil crisis in the mid-70s. Ten years later, Brazil has started implemented measures aimed at the conservation and rational use of energy. Initiatives in this regard began with the implementation of the Brazilian Labeling Program, where consumers are provided with information on the energy efficiency of appliances. However, the first energy efficiency law stimulated the most notable improvement in energy efficiency in 2001 after national energy crisis. As a result, the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labeling of Commercial, Service and Public Buildings (RTQ-C) was released in February 2009 and the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labeling of Residential Buildings (RTQ-R) was released in November 2010. Nowadays, the labeling of residential, commercial and service buildings is voluntary and the labeling of federal public buildings is mandatory since 2014. This paper presents a review of the building energy efficiency codes and labeling schemes all over the world, an overview of the Brazilian regulations on energy efficiency and discusses the labeling scheme for residential buildings adopted in Brazil. The process of its implementation, strengths and weaknesses in the present labeling scheme and the similarities and differences in relation to international experiences are described. The results obtained to date indicate that a revision is required in order to achieve a more flexible and economically viable process that will enable the program to be established as compulsory. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The building sector is one of the largest consumers of natural resources and energy in the world. Strategies to improve the energy efficiency are a solution to improve the performance of a building. However, in most cases, such strategies are assessed only at the operational phase of a building. The life-cycle energy analysis can be an important tool to allow choosing the best strategy. The objective of this paper is to assess the energy performance of four window shading systems in a house using life-cycle energy analysis. Life-cycle cost analysis was also used to determine not only the most energy-efficient strategy, but also the most economically feasible one. A house located in Florianópolis, southern Brazil, was evaluated based on a 63-year lifespan. The four window shadings analysed were: punctured concrete blocks, aluminium double sliding shutters, PVC roller shutters and wooden double open shutters. The EnergyPlus computer programme was used to estimate only the annual energy consumption for air-conditioning with and without the shading strategies. National and international databases were used to perform the life-cycle analysis. For the life cycle cost analysis, the cost of each strategy was obtained through a survey in local stores. The average inflation rate in the last ten years in Brazil was used to estimate the future costs. The results showed that the use of wooden double open shutters and PVC roller shutters are the most suitable solutions for window shading, both in terms of energy and costs, if they are not replaced during the lifespan of the building. This paper pointed out the need of using the proposed methodology to assure the right choice of strategies for energy efficiency in buildings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

A building must be sustainable and operate as economically as possible. Changes in conducting constructive processes must arise from the public sector, redirecting technological choices and investments in the sector, in order to decrease energy consumption, thus, stimulating a more sustainable behaviour of the society arising from public policies. This city features a damp climate with huge temperature variations in summer and winter. The variation in energy consumption and its connection to the local temperature and water consumption were evaluated, and consider sustainability, the correlation between water and energy consumption was evaluated. The partial results from collected data revealed no connection to the energy and water consumption variable. A considerable increase in the electric energy consumption occurs in the colder months, justified by the increased usage of heaters. Copyright © NCEUB 2017.},

	abstract = {This work develops guidance and tools to understand the performance, improve the design, and simplify the evaluation of naturally ventilated low-rise commercial buildings in warm and hot climates. We conducted ~50,000 detailed energy and airflow simulations in 427 locations across Brazil, varying 55 parameters representing building morphology, fenestration, construction properties, internal gains, operating times, wind modifiers, flowpaths, window control, and soil traits. Comfort performance was quantified by the average annual fraction of occupied hours that exceeded the upper limit of an adaptive comfort zone, and investigated with sensitivity analysis and machine learning methods. Results indicated that, after climate, building size (both footprint area and number of stories) and internal gains were most influential and were positively associated with discomfort. Adding air movement with ceiling fans and providing for night ventilation both proved highly effective comfort interventions. Except for roof solar absorptance, opaque envelope changes, including increasing insulation or thermal mass, had only marginal impacts. A support vector regression metamodel, requiring 29 easily obtainable inputs plus a weather file, was fit to the simulation results and successfully validated (R2 = 0.97). The metamodel was developed as a simplified compliance path for naturally ventilated buildings to enhance Brazil's commercial building performance labeling program, which, because it currently provides such a path only for air conditioned buildings, may discouraging decision-makers from considering even more efficient passive solutions. We use a case study to show how the metamodel, which we will distribute publicly, can also serve as a design tool, and demonstrate that modifying a small set of parameters can drastically improve thermal performance and achieve sustainable comfort in hot and warm climates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, it has been introduced to the Brazilian market without considering the local climate, predominantly tropical. The proper choice of the glass is essential to reduce energy consumption as it is through the glass that the most direct and intense heat exchange occurs. This research aims to investigate the energy performance of office buildings in Brazil that have used insulated glass units (IGUs) on the facades. The energy's analyses were conducted through computer simulation through the software EnergyPlus. Different facades' configurations were tested using different combinations of Window-to-wall-ratio (WWR) and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC). Building's models with IGUs showed an energy consumption for cooling up to 11% higher than models with laminated single-pane glass unit (SGUl) on temperate climate (southern Brazil). Modest values of energy savings, around 4%, were verified for models with IGUs in warmer climates. © (2019) by International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) All rights reserved.},

In the first step, the thermal and energy performance of the reference base model was assessed. In the second step, a sensitivity analysis was performed, varying the thermal envelope parameters of the building case study, in order to satisfy the minimum performance of the classification level A, according to the Brazilian Energy Efficiency Regulation (RTQ-R). In a third step, the external envelope of the building was optimised, through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In a last step, the numerical model defined according to the Passive House standard was optimised, in order to obtain optimal solutions. Thermal and energy performance and economic viability of the solutions were analysed. Solutions attending to RTQ-R presented additional investment between 26% and 27% and solutions attending to Passive House standard presented additional costs of 39% and 42% for the three bioclimatic zones. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This study therefore aims to investigate the credit achievement pattern of LEED 2009, which is one of the well-developed versions of LEED, by using 4021 certified projects in the US, China, Turkey, and Brazil. The results show that significant differences can be identified on most rating categories, including sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design. Using a post hoc analysis, country-specific credit allocation patterns are also identified to help developers to understand existing country-specific green building practices. In addition, it is also found that there is unbalanced achievement of regional priority credits. The study offers a useful reference and benchmark for international developers and contractors to understand the regional variations of LEED 2009 and for regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Green Building Council, to improve the rating system, especially on designing regional priority credits. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In countries with tropical climates there is a great need for air-conditioning in buildings. This is due to the high temperatures and high humidity in the tropics and sub-tropical regions such as Northeast Brazil. Overall, electricity bills show that an excessive amount of money is spent on achieving thermal comfort using regular air-conditioning systems to remove heat from buildings. The electricity consumed by such systems can represent about 50% of the total electricity bill. This paper proposes using a cogeneration system in the rectorate building of a university campus. A cogeneration system comprises a reciprocating engine as the prime mover, a back-up boiler, an accumulation tank and a single-effect absorption chiller to remove excess heat. The main advantage of using this kind of system is that increasing the production temperature of cold water improves the overall efficiency of the system as the residual heat is at a lower temperature. This solution is applied to the rectorate of the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) in João Pessoa, Northeast Brazil, where the demand for cool temperatures is intense and the consumption of energy is extremely high since the average annual relative humidity and the dry bulb temperature are about 75% and 27 °C, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Decision makers facing emission-reduction targets need to decide which abatement measures to implement, and in which order. This article investigates how marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves can inform such a decision. We re-analyse a MAC curve built for Brazil by 2030, and show that misinterpreting MAC curves as abatement supply curves can lead to suboptimal strategies. It would lead to (1) under-investment in expensive, long-to-implement and large-potential options, such as clean transportation infrastructure, and (2) over-investment in cheap but limited-potential options such as energy-efficiency improvement in refineries. To mitigate this issue, the article proposes a new graphical representation of MAC curves that explicitly renders the time required to implement each measure. Policy relevance In addition to the cost and potential of available options, designing optimal short-term policies requires information on long-term targets (e.g. halving emissions by 2050) and on the speed at which measures can deliver emission reductions. Mitigation policies are thus best investigated in a dynamic framework, building on sector-scale pathways to long-term targets. Climate policies should seek both quantity and quality of abatement, by combining two approaches: a ‘synergy approach’ that focuses on the cheapest mitigation options and maximizes co-benefits, and an ‘urgency approach’ that starts from a long-term objective and works backward to identify actions that need to be implemented early. Accordingly, sector-specific policies may be used (1) to remove implementation barriers on negative- and low-cost options and (2) to ensure short-term targets are met with abatement of sufficient quality. Indeed, such policies can avoid under-investment in the long-to-implement options required to reach long-term targets, which are otherwise difficult to enforce. © 2014, © International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank 2014.},

Besides the amount of the energy obtained, its qualitative aspect is as much as important, as it is accounted in the renewable energy share. Considering the Brazilian agricultural activity, the energy production from biomass can be still significantly increased and energy cogeneration from biomass burning is one of the process that contributes to support this grow. As an example, almost all of the more than 500 sugar cane mills in Brazil burn the sugar cane bagasse to generate electrical energy. The main waste from the energy cogeneration is the biomass ash, a mix of mineral compounds and remained carbon-based components. Portland cements and concretes are the most widely used manufactured materials in the world, consuming large quantities of raw materials and energy and being responsible for a significant share of the CO2 emissions. One of the main strategies to reduce the environmental impacts from cement production is to combine the cement clinker to supplementary cement materials (SCM), resulting in blended cements. This paper focus on the potential of biomass ashes resulted from the energy cogeneration as SCM in cement-based materials. There are presented results from research in which sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) are used as SCM, resulted in cement composites and concretes with improved properties. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Petrochemical industries have large water demands in their operations, such as distillation, extraction, washing processes and cooling systems. The present work discusses water and wastewater minimization in the production process of a Brazilian petrochemical industry, applying mass integration via mathematical programming. This research is a case study applied in industrial scale, using data from a petrochemical plant. Alternatives for water reuse were evaluated by analyzing water consumption and wastewater generation processes by using a superstructure and a nonlinear mathematical programming model. The concentration of chemical oxygen demand in effluents was considered as a limiting factor. The alternatives found in this study could lead to total economy of 280,320 m3/y of water, and 236,520 m3/y of wastewater that would no longer be generated. This volume would sufficiently supply 4626 inhabitants for one year, considering the average water consumption per capita in Brazil, which is of 166 L per capita per day. Using this process, potential benefits could be achieved with water reuse. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

But compared to countries with soaring needs like China, Brazil, and India, this region's efforts are distinguished by a shift toward diversification and away from dependence on indigenously sourced fossil fuels. Conservation of fossil fuels is being pursued not only because the hydrocarbon resources are finite but also because it makes sound financial. A discussion covers the long-term sustainable growth in the Gulf Arab states, which will depend on how well they introduce energy efficiency measures, invest in low-carbon energy supplies, improve water efficiency, and expand water desalination capacity; the regions's diversification ambitions of building ≤ 18 Gw of nuclear capacity over the next two decades; emerging solutions to address potential energy shortfalls in the region by the establishment of cross-border interconnections and power trading; and water scarcity as a paramount concern.},

Therefore, based on national standards NBR 15575 and NBR 15220, this paper points out design guidelines for social housing of net zero energy balance in Brasilia, and shows the potential and limitations of NZEBs in the city, according to bioclimatic concepts for environmental comfort and energy efficiency in buildings. This work shows the importance of reducing energy consumption in the residential sector for the generation of local energy to be feasible. Therefore, a case study was done, using the design for social housing in Brasilia, under the “Habita Brasilia” program. The house's energy consumption was estimated, as well as its thermal performance. It was then possible to plan the energy consumption reduction, improve the house's thermal performance, and set strategies for the house to produce as much energy as it consumes. This study shows that it is possible to enable NZEB social housing in Brasilia, and may encourage further studies on the suitability of the design guidelines for other Brazilian cities.

	abstract = {The construction sector is responsible for high levels of energy consumption and for environmental impacts during the life cycle of a building all over the world. Therefore, sustainability has become an inherent topic in building design, in response to the stringency of natural resources and to performance. A way to design sustainable buildings is taking advantage of the available natural resources on site to reduce the needs for artificial conditioning. Requirements of performance have become more restrictive and existing buildings must conform to them. This is possible through a retrofit process which improves their performance to comply with actual requirements, besides improving the comfort of their occupants. Most of the developed procedures for retrofitting analysis take into account only energy consumption and emission of pollutants. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a procedure to help designers and decision makers on choosing the best retrofit strategy considering energy consumption, thermal comfort and the cost-benefit of these strategies. A computational model of a building located at the State University of Campinas was developed to simulate different passive strategies and the results obtained are presented in an easy-to-use chart as part of the procedure. © 2018 Potificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

	abstract = {This paper calculates the cost-effectiveness of CO2 emissions reduction in Brazilian buildings sector. The evaluation takes into account the implementation of three public policy mechanisms which the focus is the promotion of energy efficiency (EE). The mechanisms evaluated are minimum energy performance standards (MEPS), EE requirements in public procurement regulation, and building codes. The evaluation performed through marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) shows a wide range of cost-effective EE measures, i.e., EE technologies that represent negative abatement costs once the additional investments in EE are paid back through energy savings. The main specific findings are that (1) MEPS could be broader and reach the use of energy in standby mode and tubular fluorescent lamps and should be more stringent, mainly in the case of large air conditioning devices, and (2) there is a significant cost-effective potential of emissions reduction that could be captured through mechanisms not implemented yet in the country, as public procurement regulation and building codes. In general, the total impacts are very significant and could represent an energy saving potential of 795 TWh and emissions reduction of 74 million tons of CO2 over the period from the year 2014 to the year 2030. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {In some Latin-based languages, the word precision means both accuracy and necessity. Through history, architects have thrived creating solutions both fit for their contemporary methods of fabrication and with a certain level of performance towards our needs, such as environmental comfort. Perforated elements in facades and roofings in brazilian modernist buildings are examples. Although, while necessity has usually been addressed, accuracy is commonly neglected when further customization is needed for optimal improvement in thermal and lighting comfort, both often needing accurate analyses of nature's behavior. This is usually due to the unavailability of fabrication logistics proper for mass customizing buildings elements. This paper studies how these architectural elements can evolve, starting from old inaccurate designs, then presenting a case study of an experimental building in Brazil built for a research on energy efficiency according to specific bioclimatic necessities that adapted, combined and optimized the original concepts of these elements using computational simulations, parametric modeling and genetic algorithms. Local technological conditions were respected, dealing with the low amount of customization allowed by accessible solutions and still delivering a reinterpretation of modernist architecture that, for the accurate adaptation of the envelopment to local climate, local language can understand by true, Latin-based precision. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.},

	abstract = {The practise of co-processing has been growing and is used to address socioeconomic, environmental, and energy issues. However, the uncertainties related to potential negative impacts on public health and the environment represent one of the major concerns of the competent authorities and scientific community. This research aims to assess the perception of workers in a cement plant in Brazil about sustainability (environmental, economic, social) and health issues related to the practise of co-processing, such as: pollution, conditions and safety of work, the environment, individual and collective health, employment opportunities, capacity building and training offered by the company, waste co-processing, public transparency, and active participation of the population in decision-making. A survey was conducted in a cement plant in Brazil using a questionnaire distributed to 50 workers, representing about 17% of a medium sized industry. The unit was chosen for its accessibility, as well as the fact that it is one of the 37 Brazilian industries that performs the task of co-processing and is not yet well known. Purposive sampling was used to include all workers whose work activities are directly linked to co-processing (16 workers), along with 34 representing all other plant sectors; in addition, seniority must be at least two years, and the worker must live in local communities or in surrounding cities. The results indicate positive perspectives toward most questions, except in the aspects related to the local population's knowledge about the practise of co-processing and those related to the population's participation in the decision-making processes: these aspects were both viewed negatively. The findings show that the perceptions of internal stakeholders (workers) of the cement industry are valuable in assessing the aspects related to co-processing, health risks, and environmental protection. The state environmental agencies must have the technical capacity to ensure that cement companies practise co-processing without endangering the health of workers and populations living near the industries as well as while preserving environmental conditions. The cement industry will be able to further reduce the environmental footprint of its operations and products in their final application and guarantee the safety of the workers and populations living near the industry through expertise and know-how. Sustainable cement production relies on well-educated and well-trained workers with highly efficient training programs and the creation of a supportive environment for workers; integrated pollution prevention and control with environmental management is a necessity in order to mitigate the negative effects. Populations living near the cement plant should have access to information on the environment and activities which pose danger, as well as the opportunity to participate in decision-making. © 2018},

	abstract = {In apartments, houses and hotels, showers are by far the biggest consumers of water, responding to about 25% of the total volume consumed every month. When winter hits big cities and temperatures fall, the hot water consumption increases dramatically. Since end users often dispense cold water present in the pipelines until the heated water from the reservoirs is perceived in showers or other points of use, hotels and residential buildings are responsible for a considerable waste of treated water. Several solutions based on local hardware have been proposed to partially overcome this problem, but many of them try to reduce the waste of water at the expense of reducing the efficiency of the heating and recirculating systems. The age of the IoT has brought to the smart buildings new perspectives regarding to rational use of resources, providing savings and real comfort for users. This work proposes a smart water heating scheme, mediated by IoT technology, for large buildings in urban settings. The main goal is ensuring the minimal waste of water as well as energy economy in pumping and heating systems. The proposed automated solution is built from an open-source Asterisk-based IP-PBX on cloud computing technology. A complete experimental setup considering a residential building in the southeastern region of Brazil is implemented and tested. The achieved benefits are tangible and significant when compared to the dedicated existing systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

The present research consisted of studying, building and testing low concentration solar radiation systems for photovoltaic energy conversion. The study used optical nonimaging parameters for the V-trough type radiation concentrator constructed of anodized aluminum, to reflect and to cool. Designed to concentrate radiation by about two times and consisting of a set of photovoltaic modules connected in parallel, they were modeled in the Laboratory of Energy Area in the Department of Agricultural Engineering of the Federal University of Vicosa, Brazil, at the coordinates 20°45'14" S latitude, 42°52'53" W longitude and altitude 648.74 m. They were installed to the geographic North, with the same slope as the local latitude. For comparative analysis, it was determined the electrical characteristics for evaluation of the prototype's performance with and without radiation concentration, the final productivity for cities in tropical and temperate regions and economic analysis for the system. It was concluded that the prototypes allowed for a gain of energy with concentration, about 31.3% more, and therefore a productivity gain for the analyzed cities in, kWh·kWp-1. © 2015 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Barreirinhas Basin is located in northeast Brazil and is part of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin, a new exploration frontier with complex geology. This basin is characterized by a rugose water bottom, a fast carbonate platform, shallow gas pockets, and a complex channel network. All of these elements represent a significant challenge for velocity model building and imaging of the depositional system. From preprocessing to final imaging, high-end technologies were required to meet the processing objectives. The 3D designature and 3D deghosting were crucial to remove bubble energy and ghosts related to canyon diffractions. The velocity model building exploited offset-dependent dip information in the nonlinear slope tomography-i.e., dip-constrained tomography (DCT)-to deal with small-scale lateral velocity variations. The full-waveform inversion, up to 20 Hz, was able to efficiently capture small velocity anomalies and resolve high-spatial-resolution variations that DCT could not totally solve. Even with a detailed velocity model, some dim zones and amplitude variations were still observable in the depth-migrated image. Gas pockets, responsible for the absorption and phase distortion of the seismic signal (commonly denoted by the quality factor of attenuation, Q), were detected and delineated using volumetric Q tomography. The resultant interval Q model was consistent with the geology, and its use was beneficial in a Q-compensating Kirchhoff prestack depth migration. © 2018 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an experience applied to a public university campus using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate and improve the energy efficiency of the indoor spaces of the buildings within the limits of the Federal University of Piauí, considering the lighting (installed power and luminous flux) and air conditioning (absorbed electric power and cooling capacity) input/output variables. Using Brazilian energy efficiency evaluation methods, a comparison was made between DEA and Brazilian standards, with the goal of examining DEA's performance and feasibility in efficiency improvement. The results revealed that all of the analyzed university classrooms were inefficient, which is coherent with the classification obtained by applying Brazilian standards; the calculated efficiency scores for these rooms varied from 0.7182 to 0.8477, a 0.7848 average. The DEA model, while operating in lighting and air conditioning systems, achieved a reduction of installed power of 43.5% and 22.7%, respectively, totaling a decrease of 25.6%, being able to maintain the standard characteristics of the systems mentioned. According to the DEA models, it was found that the generated targets effectively improved the efficiency of lighting and air-conditioning systems, reducing excessive inputs such as air conditioners' consumption and increasing deficient outputs such as luminous flux. It is possible to expand this successful application in the layout of the building in the whole campus area to concept small smart city projects; both have been achieved in the public buildings of the administrative body. Results from this paper revealed DEA's potential in assessing and optimizing the energy efficiency of buildings, improving their sustainability indexes, acting as a tool to support decision-making and benchmarking. © 2017 by the authors.},

For better understanding of the regulation, was elected a building, emblematic in the city of Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil, illustrating the perspective of the program. The building was classified in accordance with the two methodologies presented by the program: prescriptive and simulation, so it was possible to investigate the peculiarities of each methodology and the own regulation. After the application of the methodologies, we came to the conclusion that the prescriptive method is less accurate and requires more dedication by the evaluator to do all the calculations and surveys required, however, is the fastest tool and accessible to the field professionals. The simulation on the other hand, is a more accurate methodology and reaches levels of analysis that the prescriptive method not reaches, but still is a tool that need large initial financial contribution and prior knowledge.

In Brazil, photovoltaic technologies had a significant growth reaching 935Mw installed in 2017. Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) systems already play a significant role in electricity generation in several countries but are still not widespread in Brazil due to the lack of knowledge of their true potential. This work provides an updated review in internationally adopted concepts and definitions, and recent commercial classifications and PV technologies applicability. The regulatory current stage of implementation of PV technologies and BIPV in Brazil are in discussion and future research prospects also focusing on barriers for the expansion in the use of the systems. The development of new photovoltaic technologies brings a great potential of alternatives for the future of BIPV, with new possibilities of use, efficiency gains, and cost reduction. Brazil has high levels of solar irradiation and the advantage possibility of assimilating the experiences of other countries by adopting technologies already consolidated after decades of development. The barriers can be overcome from technical references that guide architects in their application, combining their aesthetic and functional possibilities with the gain in energy efficiency. © ZEMCH International Conference.

The project should be development focused on sustainability, explore the passive strategies and the energy generation potential of façades and roof. In this paper we analyze for the first time in Brazil and under current solar photovoltaic (PV) module prices, the technical and economic potential of integrating state-of-the-art, frameless, glass-glass thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV modules on a commercial building façade and roof, and evaluate the economic feasibility of replacing traditional façade materials like architectural glass and aluminum composite material with sleek black PV modules in six Brazilian cities. The technical analysis consisted in evaluating the energy performance of a four-storey office building for each of the six cities under analysis. The technical analysis showed that it is possible to fully meet the energy demand of the office building with PV integration in all the Brazilian cities evaluated. While the local climate has a significant impact on the energy consumption due mostly to air conditioning loads, PV energy production follows the same trend. Most importantly, the economic analysis showed that with the declining costs of photovoltaics, replacing conventional façade building materials with PV modules is not only an innovative approach but also of economic benefit. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper provides a contextual framework to analyse the EE situation in countries of Latin American Southern Cone, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, with the objective of describing the policies and projects implemented, highlighting the results achieved and outlining the path followed towards EE. A focus was placed on the building sector, where thermal performance standards and the programs to achieve EE in this sector were briefly described. Furthermore, a comparison between these standards was developed, to identify the country with the most demanding standard. As a result, it was found that all the countries are implementing several EE programs and recognising the importance of this issue within their policies. Through this paper, energy policy implications of the region can be identified, which can be useful for energy policymakers of other countries, who are beginning to consider EE policies and can take as an example the path followed by the countries analysed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the constant increase in population and built area is threatening the local sustainability. From damage prevention to future survival strategies, this paper highlights the importance of climatic design and urban directives in the struggle against a warming planet and resource depletion. One of Brasília's first super blocks, designed by Niemeyer, will serve as a case study. The discussion will focus on Brasília's iconic first housing estates and the ways they may contribute to energy efficiency as well as to the creation of strategies enabling the local community to respond to the climatic challenge. Monitored data of the present situation were analysed. The findings have suggested passive and active bio-climatic design and technology as a way forward. It is suggested that, under the current environmental circumstances, buildings are required to perform, like cars or refrigerators, like true “machines à habiter”; and their urban surroundings need to accommodate an ever-changeable microclimate in order to support the buildings' performance. © 2014 Proceedings - Windsor Conference 2014: Counting the Cost of Comfort in a Changing World.

	abstract = {In the last 30 years, voluntary and mandatory environmental or energy certification schemes have been introduced in the building sector in most developed countries. During the last decade, in Brazil, the document Energy Efficiency Rating Technical Quality Regulations for Commercial, Service and Public Buildings (RTQ-C) was introduced to classify buildings according to their energy efficiency level. This paper aims to assess how Brazilian RTQ-C could learn from the European Union (EU)’s experience of implementing the Directive 2010/31/EU. The implementation of the RTQ-C in Brazil has been examined and compared with the EU's Directive. Technical, economic and social issues as well as barriers and challenges behind the initial stage of the Directive 2010/31/EU implementation were examined. The difficulties and weaknesses of the calculation methodology, scope and labelling of the Brazilian RTQ-C regulations, and potential areas that require further research have been identified and summarised. In order to increase the impact of RTQ-C regulations, improvements to the existing calculation methodology and tools, provision of numerous supporting measures, such as an increase in training, education, public awareness and incentives, and enforcement through building regulations or standards are essential. The valuable experience from the EU's implementation of the Directive could be used to guide the development of energy policies and certification regulations in Brazil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Among them, there are the climatic characteristics (low absolute moisture content, low temperatures, high wind speeds, and rapid climate changes), the isolation and the need to preserve the natural environment. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the thermal performance and energy efficiency of new buildings of the EACF-Estação Antártica Comandante Ferraz (Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station), expected to be completed and opened in 2018, to establish parameters for acquiring new Brazilian buildings in Antarctica. To obtain the performance results from the station it was used the software Design Builder, and the study was conducted in two stages, at the first stage was made the definition of the model, the characteristics and material properties specified in the project; and in the second stage was made simulations and determined the methodology for evaluations. For the simulations were chosen an environment with greater exposure, with two faces turned to the envelope of the building. The results demonstrated the envelope performance of the building, allowing assess the materials used, pointing out possible improvements. Alternatively it was proposed to replace the galvanized steel coating specified for the envelope, for PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride), material that showed better results regarding the thermal performance and sustainability indicators. © International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to assess the feasibility of acquiring the Brazilian sustainability guide tool named “Selo Casa Azul Environmental Certification - CEF (Brazilian Federal Bank)" by the condominium Neo (Rio de Janeiro, Niterói). It is important to consider the impact of human activities in the environment on the construction industry. The Casa Azul Seal is the first classification system of sustainability of projects developed based on the characteristics of the Brazilian constructions. The sustainability guide proposes solutions appropriate to the local reality, so as to improve the use of natural resources and social benefits. The main mission of the seal is to recognize projects that adopt efficient solutions in the construction, use, occupation and maintenance of the buildings. There are 53 evaluation criteria, which are divided into six categories: urban quality, design and comfort, energy efficiency, material resource conservation, water management and social practices. The construction industry and even the built environment generally have a dominant impact on the economic, social and environmental aspects. Concerns regarding environmental issues are increasing worldwide and it is necessary to investigate new environment-friendly alternatives for the construction industry. The methodology used for the development of this chapter consists of a literature review and case study to validate the theoretical data available in the current technical literature. The literature review was through scientific articles and national and international publications, and the case study was conducted in a multi-dwelling building condominium in the city of Niterói (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). It was verified that the building would be eligible for a possible acquisition of the Casa Azul in the silver-level grading if it met the mandatory criteria 5.1 (individualized water measurement), 6.1 (education for construction and demolition waste (CDW) management) and 6.2 (environmental education of employees). However, this condominium did not meet these mandatory requirements. The mandatory criteria are indispensable to promote water savings, reuse and final disposal of CDW. Additionally, these motivate construction professionals to embrace environmental management and education causes. © 2019 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.},

	abstract = {Urbanization and the resulting concentration of people in cities has led to the emergence of Urban Heat Islands (UHI), which is associated with several problems. One strategy for UHI mitigation is the use of cool coatings for pavements and buildings, for instance, on roof tiles. Ceramic roof tiles are widely used in Brazil and in the rest of South America, but they have not been adequately studied regarding their thermal emittance and solar radiation reflectance. These two properties can be used to determine whether or not a roof tile coating can be classed as “cool”, according to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. In this paper, the solar reflectance, thermal emittance and Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) index were determined for “Portuguese” and “American” colored glazed roof tiles, mostly produced in Brazil. Nineteen glazed roof tiles (from four different producers) with different colors were studied according the LEED certification. The thermal emittance was determined using a portable emissometer and the reflectance spectral curves were measured using a UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. All measurements were performed according to the ASTM standards. The colorimetric coordinates in the visible range (for the D65 illuminant) were determined to evaluate the relationship between the luminous reflectance factor (Y) and the SRI. The optical behavior of the colored glazes for the full range of the solar spectrum was determined using the Kubelka-Munk (K-M) model and the relationship between the absorption (K) and scattering (S) coefficients. The results show that most of the colored glazed tiles did not meet the 2013 LEED requirement, that is, SRI ≥ 39 for roof tiles with a steep slope. A polynomial relationship between the Y factor and the SRI was found (R2 value > 0.95), therefore the tile colors that would probably not qualify for SRI certification could be estimated. The K-M analysis showed that for some glazes there was a high absorption of radiation in the near infrared region, suggesting that the pigments used for these glazes do not exhibit cool properties. Therefore, cool pigments with higher reflectance should be used to improve the performance of the glazes with a low SRI. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Notwithstanding there are ways of getting consumption's reduction which came throughout building automation projects applied to a building energy efficiency.

This article is an application of the methodology adopted in EN15232 for a case study in an educational institution. It deals with the energy saving estimation of an educational institution classroom through the use of automation based on the EN15232. To that, it was make use of projects factors, calculated the loads and determined the energy demand. With the knowledge gained from the equations of BAC efficiency factors, is possible to assess the energy savings that leads to a 16 % reduction.

	abstract = {The use of energy for space cooling is growing faster than any other end use in buildings, justifying the search for improvements in the energy efficiency of these systems. A simplified model to predict cooling energy consumption in Brazilian office buildings was developed. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained from consumption data obtained by building simulation. As it is intended to be applicable to different climates, a new climate indicator also appropriate for hot and humid climates was proposed and validated. The Sobol sensibility analysis was performed to reduce the number of input factors and thus the number of cases to be simulated. The data was built with the simulation of 250,000 cases in Energyplus. Studies were conducted to define the sample size to be used for the ANN training, as well as to define the best ANN architecture. The developed metamodel was used to predict the consumption of Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system of 66,300 new unseen cases. The results showed that the new proposed climate indicator was more accurate than the usual climate correlations, such as cooling degree hours. The developed metamodel presented good performance when predicting annual HVAC consumption of the cases used to obtain the model (R2 = 0.9858 and NRMSE = 0.068) and also of the unseen cases (R2 = 0.9789 and NRMSE = 0.064). © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In Brazil the housing deficit is around 5.5 million houses. To address this need, the government created a programme called "My house, My life". The main subsidies of the programme are for families earning up to three times the minimum wage. In order to formulate strategies for more energy efficiency buildings, it is necessary to understand the thermal and energy performance of what is being built. This article defines representative projects for typologies being built in the Brazilian social housing sector through the analysis of 108 projects considering two groups of income levels and investigates the thermal and energy performance of the representative projects in relation to the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labelling of Residential Buildings in Brazil for two bioclimatic zones. Five representative building models were defined. Considering the most common features found on the sample, the study suggests the importance of addresing energy efficiency measures on the sector since current building techniques for social housing shows a tendency towards a low performance in relation to the thermal and energy performance criteria of the Energy Labelling especially for lower income projects. This provides a basis for future policy and allows for more in depth studies within the sector. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In Brazil, industries consume approximately 40% of all national electrical power, and the complexity of the industrial energy system demands an appropriate energy management. Moreover, industries need suitable tools to support their strategies to meet energy efficiency regulations and promote energy gains. Through a case study, this paper proposes a multicriteria model based on the FITradeoff procedure to support a motor replacement problem in a chemical industry, in order to build a replacement plan to meet the minimum energy performance standards established by the Brazilian Energy Efficiency Law. This interactive model requires less cognitive effort from the decision-maker in comparison to the traditional tradeoff procedure, avoiding a tedious and long decision process. In addition, this model deals with the data inaccuracy through a sensitivity analysis thereby providing more robust results. After building the replacement plan, an energy performance analysis has been drawn up to evaluate the benefits of using a multicriteria decision tool to address the motor replacement problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Now due to the lack of rains in Brazil, the efficient use of the electric power became an important subject. There are federal norms that regulate the production and commercialization of products that are energetically efficient. Besides the regulations, several operational and maintenance methods exist to increase the efficiency of the use of the energy. These methods can reduce the electric power losses in these equipments and to optimize the consumption. Another viable alternative for the reduction of the consumption of energy is the use of equipments energetically efficient. Using the efficient equipments, operating these same equipments correctly and promoting the maintenances in agreement with the needs, a great amount of energy can be saved. The consumers that save energy will also be reducing the amount of tributes to be paid in their electric power bills.

	abstract = {Implementing practices for a circular economy transforms the way companies do business. Obtaining and processing systematized and optimized information facilitates decision making in order to innovate, create value and adopt measures to promote energy efficiency and sustainability in construction. Building Materials Passports (BMPs) are tools for inserting circular economy in buildings. They can be crucial in managing and providing information to stakeholders in industry value chains, with the aim of promoting the construction of more sustainable and resilient cities, where materials are identified in a database, removed and reused in order to maintain, recover or even increase value and useful life. This paper presents a proposal of a BMP applied to the wood frame system in Brazil, introducing the following guidelines: general information, safety, sustainability, use and operation, assembling directions, reuse and product service history. A case study was developed in a Brazilian company in order to test the application feasibility of the tool to the system. There were some barriers found in the development of the BMP regarding LCA data, as well as the end of life information of the material. This attempt to implement the BMP encourages practices of circular economy in the construction industry and, associated with the expanding use of wood frame in Brazil, contributes to flexible and renewable buildings. In addition, the main challenges for the introduction of BMP are discussed, emphasizing the need for joint action based on political initiatives and regulations that allow and facilitate circular practices in construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a growing interest about energy efficiency have become significantly relevant both in terms of environmental and economic aspects. Several initiatives have been launched by national and international regulations and have awakened environmental responsibility within universities worldwide. From these initiatives, reference values and index ratings were obtained for energy performance in the Universitiesâ€™ building stock. The evaluation of the positive and negative features lead, thereby, to a methodology that could verify its applicability at the University of Passo Fundoâ€”UPF, located in southern Brazil. Four aspects have been developed during the study: consumption of energy resources; comfort conditions; decision-making processes and eco-efficiency reference indexes. A simulation using the software DesignBuilder was applied in order to obtain diagnosis, real and ideal condition models. As the present study identifies and assesses the evolution of incident factors towards energy consumption, it is expected that universities promote a reflection in their practices in order to develop tools, which contribute for Educational Sustainability measures. It is imperative that making-decision practices follow guidelines to evaluate inversions and costs when measuring environmental management strategies and their implications. This paper contributes to the debate on university policies, from an inclusive perspective as it includes infrastructure and sustainable practices and, consequently, its relation to concrete exemplars in order to improve Sustainability Education practices.

The environmental benefit analysis of these strategies was performed using an indicator that includes embodied energy, potable water savings, reduction of sewage and energy consumption in the water utility, and sewage production during the life cycle of the system. The results indicated that the strategy with the greatest environmental benefit is the use of water-efficient appliances, which resulted in substantial water savings and reduction of sewage, causing low environmental impact due to lower embodied energy over the life cycle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A study of not only the use of energy during the operation but also the associated consumption and emissions in the life cycle is required. One way to reduce life cycle energy consumption is through retrofitting existing buildings. This study analysed the energy consumption and its greenhouse gas emissions after applying five sustainable retrofit measures. For this purpose, two typical neighbourhood dwellings were chosen, located in the city of Vitória, in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. The analysis was conducted for the pre-operational and operational stages. Using pre-established standards, the energy of the building materials that compose the dwellings was calculated as well as the consumed operational energy. The labelling of the building envelopes was also verified, according to the simulation method specified by the Technical Quality Requirements for Energy Efficiency Levels of Residential Buildings (RTQ-R). The software programme used to calculate performance was EnergyPlus. The results indicated that adopting all retrofit measures yielded improvements in the life cycle for only one building, namely, a 15% reduction in energy consumption and a payback time of 10.4 years. Although these results are lower than those reported in some international studies, the analysis showed significant improvements in the operational stage of both buildings, in both labelling and energy consumption. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This study analyzed the first years of post-occupancy phase of a Brazilian commercial building, certified by LEED/gold level, version 2.2. Besides energy consumption, the research covered water consumption and the commitment of users' in the adoption of sustainable practices and their perception of the certified building, as well. As main results, the study points that: measured consumption are quite higher than predicted at the design, however show a reduction trend over time; some of the credits scored due to design solution are not effective during the post-occupancy; the majority of the interviewed users are satisfied with thermal and lightning comfort and think that the certification promotes work quality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

These changes occur not only with the objective of increasing economic efficiency, water and energy of these demands but also with the purpose of mitigating the impacts of the supply. Water and energy crises have stimulated the combination of economic and environmental criteria in decision-making on technological methods that imply water and energy flows, but the analyzes are not always integrated. Due to the identification of economic equivalences or areas of indifference, in the long term (20 years), for some heating systems, regarding direct and indirect accounting and opportunity costs, paybacks and life cycles, in a given tropical economic environment, this study aimed at creating and applying an algorithm capable of combining the analysis of the economics of these systems with the evaluation of their ecoefficiency, in a single index, hierarchizing them, the main contribution of this study. The analysis reviewed experiments, simulations and noted the relative efficiency of systems in different solar irradiances. In descending order from the highest environmental impact to the lowest, the evaluated heating systems were allocated as: 1º) Low cost Solar Heating Systems of Vinyl Polychloride (SHS-VPC) and of Polypropylene (SHS-PP), with Index of Economicity and Eco-Efficiency (IEEr) = 50%; but, by the criterion of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, the SHS-VPC exceeds the SHS-PP; 2º) SHS Conventional, with IEEr = 36%; 4º) Solar Heat Pump Systems (SHPS), with IEEr = 24% and 5º) Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP), with IEEr = 15%.

As a result, it was obtained a reduction of 81% in the thermal transmittance (U), and 68% of the energy consumption of the prototype with Etics, which considerably interfered in the design of air conditioners. The system efficiency was evident when the internal temperature comparative graphs were analyzed, with the Etics prototype exhibiting more mild and stable temperatures, compared to the external environment and to the non-insulated prototype.

	abstract = {Although it is often stated that the energy consumption in buildings accounts for more than 30% of total global final energy use, only a few studies analyze updated data about the current building energy consumptions or focus on comparing different countries. Similarly, models that predict future trends in building energy demand often use contrasting algorithms which result in diverse forecasts. Scope of this paper is to present and discuss data taken from several studies about the building energy consumptions in US, EU, and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries and to provide an updated inventory of useful figures. Comparisons among countries are used to show historical, actual, and future energy consumption trends. Data presented by the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the International Energy Agency are compared with national reports as well as with research studies. The variety of the approaches used in each of the previous sources was considered fundamental to allow a complete review. The paper shows that the total building energy consumptions in BRIC countries have already overcome those in developed countries, and the continuous increase in the building stock of the BRIC countries creates an urgency for promoting building energy efficiency policies in these countries. At the same time, the policies actually adopted in developed countries are insufficient to guarantee a significant reduction in their building energy consumption in the years to come. In the current scenario, at least a doubling of the global energy demand in buildings compared to today's levels will occur by 2050. To avoid this forecast, cost-effective best practices and technologies as well as behavioral and lifestyle changes need to be diffused and accepted globally. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Climate adaptable building shells (CABS) can improve building thermal performance by modifying the envelope properties in response the dynamic environmental boundary conditions. This paper intends to evaluate the improvement potential of building thermal performance using seasonal adaptable facades in residential buildings with high thermal load in a humid subtropical climate. A case study is performed in south-eastern of Brazil, in order to identify the optimal seasonal adaptation strategies. The analysis is based on optimization scenarios. The numbers of overcooling and overheating hours are the indicators of performance. The adaptive comfort model, Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, bases the measurement of the comfortable hours. The optimization of the results is conducted using the software MatLab and the computational simulations are conducted using EnergyPlus. Results of this study show the improvement in environmental quality through monthly adaptation of six facade designs parameters. Separate analyses are made for the summer and the winter. The potential on thermal performance improvement in this case study reduced up to 26% of the discomfort time with the adaptive facade. Reducing the number discomfort hours reduces energy consumption by the use of cooling or heating systems. Copyright © NCEUB 2017.},

The system efficiency was evident when the internal temperature comparatve graphs were analyzed, with the Etcs prototype exhibitng more mild and stable temperatures, compared to the external environment and to the non-insulated prototype.

	abstract = {Lebanon is a country that has a heavy dependence on energy imports in order to meet its domestic demand. Although it is a relatively small country, it rivals countries like Mexico and Brazil in electric power consumption per capita at 3,102 kWh/person. The Lebanese economy has a very high energy cost to GDP ratio, which translates to more money being spent on energy. Prior to 1975, more than 40 percent of Lebanon’s produced power was hydroelectric; however, due civil war, the majority of this infrastructure was damaged. Today, Lebanon depends on rehabilitated Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and Light Fuel Pol (LFO) power plants to satisfy its demand; a strategy that has, thus far, proved insufficient in satisfying the country’s energy demand. A large portion of this demand comes from existing commercial and residential buildings and developments. This accounts for upwards of 60 percent of the electricity consumption in the country. Building owners and businesses throughout the region, and the world, are starting to realize that energy consumption needs to be reduced before tackling supply side problems. The concept of Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is one of the most effective mechanisms that can be used to tackle this problem. An EPC is an innovative solution that enables the reduction of energy consumption and demand using paid-from-savings, performance based mechanisms. The owner of a building does not pay upfront costs, and only pays a portion of the savings once it is generated. Deployed on a country-wide scale, this model can significantly aid deficient capacity by dealing with demand side consumption. In most cases, an EPC lays the groundwork for making energy efficiency upgrades to buildings and assets at no cost to the owner. The capital expenditure required to implement these upgrades are paid for throughout the life of the contract by the savings generated; a structure that ensures payment that is based solely on performance. A strong working mechanism between Lebanese government bodies, building owners, energy services companies and finance providers can help reduce the impact of buildings on the environment, while reducing energy demand and increasing asset profitability and value. © 2018 Amer.

Nevertheless, building insulation can generate high expenditures so that the selection of an optimum insulation thickness requires a detailed energy simulation as well as an economic analysis. In this way, the present study proposes an innovative non-uniform adaptive method to determine the optimal insulation thickness of external walls. First, the method is compared with a reference solution to properly understand the features of the method, which can provide high accuracy with less spatial nodes. Then, the adaptive method is used to simulate the transient heat conduction through the building envelope of buildings located in Brazil, where there is a large potential of energy reduction. Simulations have been efficiently carried out for different wall and roof configurations, showing that the innovative method efficiently provides a gain of 25% on the computer run-time. © 2019, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

This study investigated the impact of climate change on thermal comfort conditions and on heating and cooling energy demand in dwellings in three cities in Brazil. Scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was selected to be used in the study. To quantify the impact, the Climate Change World Weather File Generator was used to produce weather data for future typical meteorological years, such as 2020, 2050 and 2080. The EnergyPlus computer programme was used to estimate the indoor air temperature and the annual heating and cooling energy demand in the future. In order to maintain the energy consumption in the houses at the level it is nowadays, passive design strategies such as solar shading, low absorptance and thermal insulation were assessed. Results show that there will be an increase in the annual energy demand ranging from 19%–65% among the three cities in 2020; 56%–112% in 2050; and 112%–185% in 2080. In the coldest city, the annual heating energy demand will decrease by 94% in 2080 due to an increase in the average temperature and global solar radiation. The use of passive design strategies may reduce up to 50% the future annual cooling and heating energy demand in houses in Brazil. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In a planned city, such as Brasilia, understanding characteristics from urban codes and legislation may be the first step towards improvements and optimization of architectural shape and building envelope, especially in non-residential buildings. Therefore, this article focuses on morphological characterization and energy consumption of office buildings in the central area of Brasilia and seeks to characterize transformations in the envelope and building morphology between 2010 and 2017. The method consists of on-site visits and analysis through Google Street View tool of morphological features, envelope and energy consumption of 223 buildings. Simultaneously, energy consumption data were collected in the last three years. The results showed that, in 2017 little was made to follow the recommendation presented by International Energy Agency towards efficient envelopes. Almost 40% of the studied buildings had almost entirely glazed facades and 70% of the facades did not have any type of window shading. Copyright © NCEUB 2017.},

Aiming to overcome these difficulties this study develops a framework to estimate the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) baseline of an existing building stock category based on the investigation of land use regulations, a land tax database and field surveys. These offer a starting point to estimate current energy consumption and promising interventions without having to study specific buildings in depth. A case study of the high-rise commercial building stock took place in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Three representative typologies were identified. For each of these, archetype energy models were created in order to assess EUI. The analysis of the EUI baselines highlights differences between archetypes, explaining the impact of technical choices on the overall electricity consumption and indicating a growing tendency of energy consumption for forthcoming buildings. The archetype analysis also provides knowledge to identify the most promising energy savings potential and thus to support further energy policies in the city. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges of hospital architecture is solve of the paradigm of natural ventilation versus indoor air quality for promote the reduction of risks of transmissions of infectious hospital diseases. This study aims to evaluate the levels of air renewal through natural ventilation in nursing hospital settings to promote the fight against hospital infection. The object of study is a ward of the Base Hospital of the Federal District - Brasília, which is one of the reference hospitals in Brazil and one of the only ones that exclusively uses natural ventilation as a strategy to obtain the comfort of its wards. The methodology used was computer simulation using Autodesk 2015 Computational Fluid Dynamics software to verify the air renewal rates that were compared with the minimum indices established by the internal air quality control standards. The results of the simulations obtained show an internal air renewal rate of 83.0 m3 / hour. It is concluded through the CFD simulations that the natural ventilation in health environments can promote an adequate rate of air renewal promoting environments with a good quality of air making humanization and the improvement the hospital treatment, culminating in a Reduction of the building's energy consumption.

	abstract = {Purpose - Energy use in urban areas has turned a subject of local and worldwide interest over the last few years, especially emphasized by the correlated greenhouse gases emissions. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the overall energy efficiency potential and emissions resulting from integrated solutions in urban energy planning, in the scale of districts and neighbourhoods in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on the description and the application of a method to analyse energy performance of urban areas and support their planning. It is a quantitative bottom-up method and involves urban morphology, urban mobility, buildings and energy supply systems. Procedures are applied to the case study of Agua Branca urban development area, located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Findings - In the case of Agua Branca area, energy efficiency measures in buildings have shown to be very important mostly for the buildings economies themselves. For the area as a whole, strategies in promoting public transport are more effective in terms of energy efficiency and also to decrease pollutant emissions. Originality/value - Literature review has shown there is a lack of approaches and procedures able to support urban energy planning at a community scale. The bottom-up method presented in this paper integrates a plenty of disaggregated and multisectoral parameters at the same stage in urban planning and shows that is possible to identify the most promising actions by building overall performance indexes. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

These failures impact energy efficiency, provision of adequate indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and occupant satisfaction. Detailed energy audits of 33 office buildings in Brazil are used to map and categorise the performance issues which lead to energy inefficiency and inadequate IEQ. Four buildings use occupant satisfaction questionnaires to complement the audit and evaluate the impact of failures on users. A total of 333 failures are identified and categorised in 51 separate modes. The causes of failures are identified as errors in building design and construction (D&C) or operations and maintenance (O&M). Some issues require retrofit procedures, but most can be corrected by adapting O&M procedures. Small- and medium-sized offices generally repeat the same failure modes; automated procedures or checklists and training could optimise performance in these buildings. Large offices are likely to require commissioning expertise in newer buildings, while older buildings require automation systems or full retrofits. The effects of O&M and building management are seen to have greater impacts on performance and occupant satisfaction than factors such as design, year of construction or building HVAC system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Mechanical cooling and ventilating of buildings is responsible for a significant proportion of their energy consumption. In any benchmarking strategy or operational performance assessment for energy efficiency, it is important to consider calculations or correction factors to account for the impacts of external conditions on the cooling load. Many emerging economies have stocks of commercial buildings of which some operate in fully air-conditioned modes and others in mixed-mode, using air conditioning for a significant proportion of the year. In warm climates, these buildings may interact with the external climate in different ways. In detailed analyses of energy consumption in 32 office buildings across Brazil, buildings are categorised according to HVAC system type and energy consumption is calculated end-use. For each building, the statistical relationship between climate and energy consumption is measured, using cooling degree hours. Buildings which are fully air conditioned show large variations in energy consumption, indicating that although they are conditioned to standard temperatures, they face operational challenges. The buildings with mixed-mode operation are shown to have a more even correlation with external conditions even at high temperatures. This result has implications for steady-state building energy models, benchmark development and climate correction calculations for monitoring and verification. Copyright © NCEUB 2017.},

In addition to allowing consumers to evaluate the best products froman energy point of view, it sets targets to make the products increasingly more efficient. In this context, buildings that can currently obtain the energy efficiency label are also included, demonstrating to customers the concern for sustainability. However, there are still many products and systems that can be labeled but for which legislation has not yet been enacted, includingwater supply systems. Owing to the different characteristics of the systems and the different possibilities for efficiency improvement, it is necessary to develop indicators that actually represent the reality of each system and make it possible to compare them. Thus, this study proposes the use of certain indicators for classification of the systems. A classification by sector benchmarking is also proposed in Brazil, and an example is presented for the classification of Brazilian systems based on four indicators obtained by the National Sanitation Information System. © IWA Publishing 2015.},

This paper assesses methods to quantify the performance of naturally conditioned residences in hot humid weather of Brazil. A model of social housing building and variations in its constructive systems were simulated using DesignBuilder software and the performances calculated through different thermal comfort classification methods. The goal was to compare the rates and select the method more sensible to design variations and the influence of air movement, an important strategy for maximizing heat loss and thus improving the thermal comfort of buildings in hot humid climate. The methods employed were the adaptive methods of Auliciems (1981, cited in Szokolay, 2004), Nicol and Humphreys (2002), and de Dear and Brager (2002), combined with the air movement effect in thermal comfort presented in Szokolay and Docherty (1999), Nicol (2004) and ASHRAE (2010) respectively, besides Fanger model (Fanger, 1972) and degree-hours. The index proposed by de Dear and Brager (2002) was more sensitive to variables changes, covering a greater range of thermal zones, besides greater linearity with method of degree-hour, used in the regulation of energy efficiency level in the country. © 2016 NCEUB.

	abstract = {Current air conditioning systems have become consistently energy-efficient, but usually, these systems represent the largest electricity consumer in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The variability in electricity costs also imposes uncertainties in the future operational costs of air conditioning installations. This study presents an economic analysis considering technical aspects related to the integrated use of solar photovoltaic, as a complementary energy source, and air conditioning systems connected to the utility grid. Two different systems, variable refrigerant flow and chillers, were analyzed in two cities in Brazil, Recife and São Paulo, with varying levels of irradiation and temperature. A mathematical model to evaluate the economic benefits of the integrated use of these systems was implemented considering conditionals and functional aspects of the locations, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. A sensitivity analysis using Sobol's method to determinate the most sensitive parameters affecting the economic results of the proposed system has been carried out. The results reveal high economic viability for all the systems studied and their most critical variables, namely energy price, energy price annual adjustment, photovoltaic cost and solar panel efficiency. Finally, the findings show that the implementation of air conditioning systems with solar photovoltaic energy could assure high internal rate of return for both cities, with average values around 28% for Recife and 22% for São Paulo, and the variable refrigerant flow system simulations resulted in better indexes when compared to chiller indexes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Buildings consume nearly 40% of primary energy production globally. Certified green buildings substantially reduce energy consumption on a per square foot basis and they also focus on indoor environmental quality. However, the co-benefits to health through reductions in energy and concomitant reductions in air pollution have not been examined.We calculated year by year LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification rates in six countries (the United States, China, India, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey) and then used data from the Green Building Information Gateway (GBIG) to estimate energy savings in each country each year. Of the green building rating schemes, LEED accounts for 32% of green-certified floor space and publically reports energy efficiency data. We employed Harvard's Co-BE Calculator to determine pollutant emissions reductions by country accounting for transient energy mixes and baseline energy use intensities. Co-BE applies the social cost of carbon and the social cost of atmospheric release to translate these reductions into health benefits. Based on modeled energy use, LEED-certified buildings saved $7.5B in energy costs and averted 33MT of CO2, 51 kt of SO2, 38 kt of NOx, and 10 kt of PM2.5 from entering the atmosphere, which amounts to $5.8B (lower limit = $2.3B, upper limit = $9.1B) in climate and health co-benefits from 2000 to 2016 in the six countries investigated. The U.S. health benefits derive from avoiding an estimated 172-405 premature deaths, 171 hospital admissions, 11,000 asthma exacerbations, 54,000 respiratory symptoms, 21,000 lost days of work, and 16,000 lost days of school. Because the climate and health benefits are nearly equivalent to the energy savings for green buildings in the United States, and up to 10 times higher in developing countries, they provide an important and previously unquantified societal value. Future analyses should consider these co-benefits when weighing policy decisions around energy-efficient buildings. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Brazil faces a housing deficit of more than 5.5 million units and nearly 11 million existing homes present inadequate living conditions. In response, the Brazilian government launched in 2009 a mass social housing programme with a target of delivering 24 million new units for low-income households by 2022. Their standardised design is relatively cheap to build but does not take into account climatic conditions, thermal comfort and energy efficiency. This could result in poor performance and uncomfortable indoor environments that could impact of the occupier's health and lead to the unnecessary use of energy-hungry space conditioning systems. Given the scale of this programme, the potential impact on Brazil's already debilitated socio-economic and environmental balance is very substantial. In this work, the authors have deployed sensitivity analysis to explore a variety of envelope combinations through dynamic building simulation for three southern Brazilian cities, Curitiba, Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre, aiming to achieve better than the typical performance. Thermal transmittance properties and air permeability rates were tested from the most common construction characteristics in Brazil to some of the highest levels of fabric energy efficiency. These combinations were also analysed in terms of their cost-effectiveness. The results suggested that optimised envelopes could improve thermal comfort by up to 97% in comparison to a typical envelope, but also cost nearly 50% more. Other envelope combinations investigated were shown to be more cost-effective with a significant increase of thermal comfort levels and were therefore considered to be a more adequate solution for the context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Most of the current researches about energy consumptions deals with statistics in a specific country. However, international comparisons are useful to discover historical, actual, and energy consumption trends. Data presented in reports of the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,and the International Energy Agency are compared with national reports as well as with research studies. This analysis shows that the BRIC countries have already overcome the total energy consumption of developed countries, and the expansion of their building stock raises an imperative urgency for energy efficiency in buildings. At the same time, this paper shows that the measures actually adopted in developed countries are insufficient to guarantee a significant reduction in their energy consumption inbuildings. © 2015 The Authors.

The thermal performance of the IEPCS is analyzed, originally developed for a dwelling located in hot-humid Maracaibo, Venezuela (Vivienda Bioclimática Prototipo - VPB-1). Diverse configuration modes were tested as part of the experimental field study, from which predictive formulas were generated and validated. The paper shows results of the expected thermal performance of the IEPCS for 411 Brazilian cities, which were obtained from the application of predictive formulas to a database consisting of TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) climate files. The efficiency of the passive cooling system was evaluated for each city with regard to its capability in reducing indoor temperatures relative to outdoors as well as Degree-Day percentages above the upper limit of the adaptive comfort zone. Detailed results for four Brazilian locations are also discussed. Results suggest that the system is capable of ensuring thermal comfort conditions for most of the cities evaluated. Average indoor temperatures reached reductions up to 2.5°C below outdoor conditions; such reductions depend fundamentally on the wet bulb temperature depression. From such results, it is suggested that the IEPCS could have a great applicability in Brazil with a strong potential for improving indoor comfort conditions and, in the case of air-conditioned buildings, also promote a reduction of the energy demand on HVAC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

One important strategy employed to turn these laws and regulations effective is through building certification. The benefit of such practice may reflect in energy savings, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, to end-users and real estate owners. The objective of this study is to make a literature review concerning energy efficiency policies and regulations for buildings, highlighting how the Brazilian labeling program can be improved compared to the United States and Portugal programs. It is important to point out that the Brazilian program is under consolidation in comparison with the Portuguese and American ones. Furthermore, the assessment shows that: (i) although it is an initiative in the interest of society and it is meant to several types of buildings, the Brazilian labeling program does not inform suggestions for the building improvements; (ii) it is not mandatory; (iii) it does not value net-zero energy building; (iv) it does not inform the CO2 emissions savings; and (vi) it is not sufficiently stringent to challenge the building industry to improve the efficiency levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Most life cycle assessments have focused on impacts associated with the energy efficiency of buildings, in particular during the operational phase. However, the construction phase of buildings accounts for a significant share of a building's embodied energy and is responsible for impacts related to resource depletion. With the aim to contribute to more all-embracing assessments in the construction sector, this study aims to compare three different wall types commonly used in Brazil, according to their environmental performances: ceramic brick, concrete brick and cast-in-place reinforced concrete exterior walls. The results were analyzed with the software SimaPro 7.3 and with the life cycle impact assessment method IMPACT 2002+ (version Q2.2). Ceramic brick walls have less impact than the concrete brick and the cast-in-place reinforced concrete exterior walls on three different endpoint indicators (Climate Change, Resource Depletion and Water Withdrawal). The results were not significant regarding impacts on Human Health and Ecosystem Quality. Different sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to test the final results, as well as uncertainty analysis, related to the variability of inventory data and the characterization of the life cycle inventory results into midpoints and/or endpoints. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The methodology to judge in which level a building is sustainable in Brazil is incipient, without orientation and hardly ever there is a diffusion of these methods inside Brazilian territory. Almost all developed countries have their appropriate certification methodology for sustainable constructions. Some of these methodologies could be adapted to developing countries. The aim of this work is to study the processes of environmental assessment in buildings that have been adapted in Brazil, comparing their parameters. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) imported from the United States and Alta Qualidade Ambiental (AQUA) adapted from HQE-France. Both methodologies were imported and adapted to the reality of Brazilian construction. It can be concluded that both certification processes qualitatively evaluate the specified parameters, such as energy, water and waste management, among others and need to be adapted to the countries where they will be applied, considering their specific climate conditions and legislations. © 2015 Vanessa Silva Pugliero, Lorenzo Campos Coiado, Lia Lorena Pimentel, Ana Elisabete Paganelli Guimarães de Avila Jacintho, Lia Toledo Moreira Mota, Alexandre de Assis Mota.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the interaction of users with internal blinds on the energy efficiency of an office building. Firstly, based on the results obtained from the application of questionnaires to users of an office building located in Florianópolis, southern Brazil, three behavioural patterns (two passive and one active) were identified. The first passive behaviour consists of maintaining the internal blinds open at all times while the second group of passive users is comprised of those who keep the internal blinds closed at all times, throughout the year. The active user tends to open the internal blinds upon arrival at the workplace and to close them when solar radiation higher than 50 W/m2 is perceived on the work surface. The influence of behavioural patterns on the energy efficiency of buildings was investigated by performing computer simulations using DIVA for Rhino plug-in. Users who keep the internal blinds open are associated with greater daylight use, but also with increases in the thermal load inside the building. On the other hand, users who keep the internal blinds closed at all times contribute by reducing the energy consumption required for cooling, but they also reduce the daylight use. Active users tend to be associated with an intermediate energy consumption compared to the passive behavioural patterns for both lighting and cooling, as there is a balance between daylight use and thermal load when the blinds are adjusted. The increase in the average energy consumption, compared to the active users, was 5.3% for the users who keep the blinds open and 26.1% for those who keep the internal blinds closed. Thus, as a general trend, it was noted that user interaction with the internal blinds is important in terms of achieving gains in building energy efficiency. The behaviour of the active users results in lower energy consumption when compared to passive users and thus it is important to make users aware of their influence on achieving more energy efficient buildings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Light pipes are one of the technologies capable of conducting light over long distances. However, they require local studies to check the most efficient performance in each geographical location. This paper aims to study the performance of a given light pipe combined with a heliostat device in Porto Alegre, a city in south Brazil. We conducted an experiment in which scale models were used. Different reflexive materials were tested and, as a second step, light pipes combined with the use of a handmade heliostat were verified. At the end, rapid prototyping tools where used to build and test an automatized heliostat. Our results pointed to a great potential for using these technologies in deep environments on cloudless days. However, in overcast weather their efficiency drops considerably, so the use of hybrid systems may be an alternative. Heat load conduction and glaring caused by direct sunlight are some of the main limitations of these systems and must be addressed in future experiments. Copyright © NCEUB 2017.},

	abstract = {Energy demand in buildings has increased considerably in recent years, and in developing countries many non-residential buildings are considered efficient by energy labelling programs, despite their high-energy consumption and little environmental conditioning strategies. In the design process, there are several variables to be considered that may be contradictory to each other, and computational multi-objective optimization methods represent a significant potential to generate solutions for a good design. This paper investigates the thermal-energy performance for a single room model in a Brazilian subtropical climate using a multi-objective optimization. A single-storey office building was defined as model for a Building Performance Simulation (BPS) with EnergyPlus and a parametric analysis was conducted using MATLAB. The glazing U-factor, concrete layer thickness on the walls, and roof solar absorptance were optimized from the model's base case. The analysis was evaluated from two optimization criteria (annual electricity demand and hours of discomfort for heating and cooling). Results showed a tendency to reduce energy consumption in 9.6% and lead thermal comfort to a neutral state from the case in two multi-objective optimization phases. This paper demonstrates that optimization methods for BPS can assist in high-efficient office buildings, even in the early design process. Copyright © NCEUB 2017.},

	abstract = {In 2009, the general development plan for the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Plano Diretor UFRJ 2020 in Portuguese) was approved for the period between 2009 and 2020. A significant effort was made to incorporate in-house innovative solutions as much as possible. Such strategy was supposed to (1) directly benefit the University with solutions created within its own research programs; (2) serve as a privileged showroom of its potential contributions to the community; and (3) pioneer applications that may be adopted in urban areas in the near future. UFRJâ€™s main campus is located in an island, with an area of circa 5.2Â km2, 5Â km in length and 1Â km in width. Its daily population is estimated in 60,000 persons, including students, faculty, technical, administrative and support workers, and visitors. More than 25,000 vehicles circulate every day along its main avenues. Besides the university buildings and installations, 15 other research centres are also located in the campus. These features provide the ideal conditions for UFRJâ€™s main campus to become a lively and efficient laboratory of a smart city of the future. The synergy generated by the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary knowledge can be maximised by turning the Plano Diretor UFRJ 2020 into reality. Based on such premises, an occupation plan was conceived. The main idea was to transform the University Campus in part of the city creating urban spaces, integrating internal disciplinary areas and the University with the urban fabric nearly. Unfortunately, due to recent political unrest and a deep economic crisis that currently plague Brazil, the implementation of a significant part of the plan has been postponed. Nevertheless, the internal mobility project, featuring a Magnetically Levitated (MagLev) vehicle is going forward. This paper describes the development of the project, known as MagLev-Cobra, since the proof of its concept in the year of 2000, until its final implementation, due to 2020. The frame of technology development, established by NASA and known as Technological Readiness Levels (TRLâ€™s), will be used as reference. The cooperation between various university departments and companies, some of them spin-off incubated companies, will be stressed, as an example of the positive impacts from cooperative work in research, teaching, innovation and technological development.

	abstract = {Computational simulation is widely used for the evaluation of buildings energy efficiency levels, but software's high level of complexity makes this process costly both in financial and in time-consuming terms. Thus, simplified simulation interfaces and tools have the potential to make the process more accessible to the actors in the construction field, presenting faster results than detailed simulations -becoming a research field that is worth investigating. This article aims to investigate the advances of the Brazilian simplified simulation tool, S3E, developed by the Laboratory of Energy Efficiency in Buildings (LabEEE) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina. It intends to analyze its potential to become an official tool to obtain the energy certification according to the Brazilian Labeling RTQ-C. A review of studies about this interface was made, comparing S3E with interfaces of same concept, as CE3 and CE3X from Spain and Atmospheres, developed in the USA followed by a practical utilization of the tool. From the analysis and comparison of data, it was noticed that the Brazilian interface presented important improvements after the publication of the related studies analyzed in this article, that have the potential to maximize its precision; and that the Spanish and American tools have characteristics that may indicate a development path for S3E. The results obtained in this study points out to research opportunities related to the development of the Brazilian tool for its use regarding the Brazilian RTQ-C Labeling Program, and presents S3E main updates, helping architects, engineers and students in its better comprehension. © 2017 The Authors.},

The presence of vulnerable points in the envelope of the building may influence the energy performance, and may also have consequences for the building maintenance, such as favoring conditions for the filamentous fungi formation. Globally, several countries already have standards or regulations on the subject. In Brazil, none of the regulations deals with this problem. This work aims to evaluate the impact of thermal bridges of reinforced concrete structure on the thermal energy performance of a residential building in southern Brazil, considering three different possibilities to model the thermal bridge in Energy Plus software. The results show that the type of modeling influences the values of energy consumption and the thermal comfort indexes in the building. The different models can reach a consumption difference of up to 20% depending on the level of the building insulation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to compare primary energy consumption and energy efficiency during the operation phase of different types and combinations of water heating systems in single-family dwellings. Systems with an electric shower, liquefied petroleum gas heater, and solar heater with electric backup were analysed. The analysis was performed by means of computer simulation using EnergyPlus. Three Brazilian cities with different climates were assessed, i.e., Curitiba, Brasília and Belém. The systems were compared in terms of final energy and primary energy consumption. Results showed that systems with an electric shower, which have a lower water flow rate, led to lower primary energy consumption. The solar heating system combined with an electric shower was the option with the lowest energy consumption, and the solar heating system with a heating element in the storage tank was the option that consumed more energy. The systems were sized according to the requirements of the Brazilian energy efficiency labelling for residential buildings, and the efficiency level was compared to the results of primary energy consumption. The electric shower was found to be the third lowest energy consumer, but it was ranked the least energy efficient by Brazilian labelling, while systems with high energy consumption, such as gas heaters and solar heaters with a heating element in the storage tank, were ranked the most energy efficient. Therefore, a review of the requirements and methodology of the Brazilian energy efficiency labelling for residential buildings is recommended in order to encourage the use of truly efficient systems. Public policies that encourage solar heating systems should establish requirements regarding the configuration and sizing both the solar heating system and the backup system. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this work, the aim is to study the indoor temperature field changes caused by the application of different materials on a flat roof. This study is set in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, where the strong heat sometimes associated with the bad location of openings in the buildings and the choice of materials can cause thermal distress. In the old areas of the city, a kind of construction called "villa" can be found, i.e., a dead end small street with only one inlet/outlet. Sometimes the houses built in the "villas" are very small with no space around them, so it is necessary to deal with the impossibility of introducing cross-ventilation in a traditional way. The target is to evaluate temperature changes focusing on the adoption of different roof materials so as to identify which one can provide the best results in terms of cooling. The thermal changes were checked including a solar gain factor related to some specific hours; 7 a.m., 12 a.m. and 4 p.m. The analysis started by solving the air-circulation problem to determine the wind fields, using a mixed stabilized finite element method, like Petrov-Galerkin, applied to the full Navier-Stokes equations. The thermal problem is analyzed through the SUPG - Streamline Up-wind Petrov-Galerkin stabilized finite element method. These computational results are important to test low cost operational interferences before implementing the project. The analysis of the use of different roof materials allows us larger cost efficiency both environmentally and economically.},

	abstract = {Most Brazilian buildings have low performance in terms of energy, since they received little attention (or none) concerning energy efficiency. In 2009, new perspectives to change this situation emerged, due to an initiative by the Federal Government, that established the necessary regulations for energy efficiency labelling in buildings, and broadened the Brazilian Labelling Program, which, up until then, encompassed only machinery and equipment. Never before had that happened in Brazil: conditions were defined for the classification of commercial buildings according to their energy efficiency, considering lighting and air-conditioning systems, and the architectural envelope. The major purpose of this article is to analyze, from a business point of view, the compliance with the new regulations for energy efficiency labelling in hotel buildings, where small businesses are predominant. Hotels have been targeted for large investments, since they have become the pillars of Brazil's project to welcome tourists during the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. The outcome of this article is a broad analysis on the application of new regulations for labelling the level of energy efficiency of the hotel business, based on two perspectives: the external environment (opportunities and threats) and the internal environment (strengths and weaknesses).},

	abstract = {Investing more in renewable energy sources and using this in a rational and efficient way is vital for the sustainable growth of world. Energy efficiency (EE) will play an increasingly important role in future generations. The aim of this work is to estimate how much the PNEf (National Plan for Energy Efficiency) launched by the Brazilian government in 2011 will save over the next 5 years by avoiding the construction of additional power plants, as well as the amount of the CO2 emission.The marginal operating cost is computed for medium term planning of the dispatching of power plants in the hydro-thermal system using Stochastic Dynamic Dual Programming, after incorporating stochastic energy efficiencies into the demand for electricity. We demonstrate that even for a modest improvement in energy efficiency (<1% per year), the savings over the next 5 years range from R$ 237 million in the conservative scenario to R$ 268 million. 11US$ 1.00=R$ 1.99 in January 31, 2013. in the optimistic scenario. By comparison the new Belo Monte hydro-electric plant will cost R$ 26 billion to be repaid over a 30 year period (i.e. R$ 867 million in 5 years). So in Brazil EE policies are preferable to building a new power plant. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The objective here is to bring together the advantages of both methods in order to provide more valuable insights to policy makers. The MCA results show that in the case of more integrative policies, which considers, for instance, potential of jobs creation, the mechanisms to foster distributed RES and solar water heaters are better ranked than in MACC analysis, where only cost-effectiveness of each option is evaluated. Other key finding is that: (1) there is a significant cost effective potential that could be reached through alternative mechanisms not implemented yet in the country, such as public procurement regulation and building codes and; (2) minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) could be broader in scope and more stringent and include the use of energy in standby mode and tubular fluorescent lamps. In particular, some important appliances such as large air conditioning devices should have more aggressive MEPS. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Historically, many ancient civilizations erected buildings that happened to have high thermal inertia. In places with high daily amplitude of air temperature and intense solar radiation, buildings made of heavy elements with high thermal capacity showed improved interior thermal environment conditions. Due to environmental concerns, recent studies have taken up this concept, indicating its potential in improve thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption in HVAC in small buildings exposed to various different weather conditions. Other studies have also revealed the main factors affecting building thermal inertia. One that stands out is the position of thermal insulation in the building envelope, which provides different thermal responses of buildings for the same value of thermal resistance. In Brazil, many air-conditioned office buildings have low thermal inertia prioritizing, instead, the thermal insulation of the envelope, characterized by maximum values of thermal transmittance, in accordance with Brazilian legislation for energy efficiency. This work presents an analysis of the energy performance of a small office building located in the city of São Paulo, considering eight different kinds of walls, with the same thermal resistance, varying the effective thermal capacity by changing the position of the insulating layer. The building thermal response was obtained by computer simulations using the EnergyPlus software, considering various conditions of occupancy of the building and air-conditioning. The results show that the building had better energy performance with walls of greater thermal capacity in all situations. We conclude that in small office buildings, exposed to the climatic conditions of cities like São Paulo, it is possible to improve the buildings thermal performance considering not only the minimum values of thermal walls resistance, as required by specific legislation, but also higher values of thermal capacity. © 2014 ASHRAE.},

Thus, it was investigated the relationship of thermal comfort with the possibility of reducing the energy consumption of active conditioning systems. The method comprises the computer simulation of a 63m2</ sup> single-family housing construction, using the software EnergyPlus. The simulated model has no active conditioning system. Natural ventilation was simulated with EnergyPlus through the algorithm, AirflowNetwork, a model of ventilation network, where mass flows through openings and loss of thermal load due to pressure differences in building are estimated. The condition for opening the window depends on external temperature and a prescribed maximum internal temperature, which supposes the use of natural ventilation only as daytime passive cooling tool. For the study two cases were simulated by varying the thermal properties of the constituent components of the roofing and of vertical components. Variations studied represent the application of different constructive elements of practice in the construction market in the country. The options described were also simulated for three Brazilian cities with different climates, in the situations ventilated and unventilated, totaling 12 different simulations. The comparative analysis was performed by checking the comfort hours and simultaneously quantifying the sensible heat loss due to the use of natural ventilation, for each simulated event. Results indicate the importance of natural ventilation combined with the use of adaptive models for thermal comfort and the possibility of significant reduction in energy consumption resulting from this design strategy. © 2012 IEEE.},

Field measurements during a warm period (01-March-2008-07-March-2008) and during a cold period (25-May-2008-31-May-2008) included internal air temperature of rooms, internal and external surface temperature of three types of roofs (green, ceramic and metallic), heat fluxes through these roofs, green roof's temperature profile, water volumetric content in substrate layer and meteorological data. During the warm period, the green roof reduced heat gain by 92-97% in comparison to ceramic and metallic roofs, respectively, and enhanced the heat loss to 49 and 20%. During the cold period, the green roof reduced heat gain by 70 and 84%, and reduced the heat loss by 44 and 52% in comparison to ceramic and metallic roofs, respectively.

It is necessary to study about information standards of thermal comfort situations for animals, for this to be better understood by producers. The locations of rural buildings can be an evidence of the needs for an adequate choice of construction material or efficient cooling system. Researchers of rural buildings and ambient area use environmental physical parameters to characterize the situations to which animals are subjected. One of these parameters is enthalpy, which measures the amount of energy in a system, related with latent and sensible heat. This information allows microclimate thermal analysis of animal production systems. Thus, the present work aimed to assess geostatistical techniques concerning temperature and relative humidity and to calculate the enthalpy in 25 points of the State of Sao Paulo. Brazil, at meteorological stations in summer season. The points were used with ordinary kriging to establish a contiguous map listing all other prediction points through the chosen model. The results show on the maps regions of stress and comfort situations for poultry production between the first until the tfh week, with the areas of higher and lower risk for this production system. Thus, during the period of assessment, it was possible verify kriging maps related with the situation presented greater thermal comfort, suggesting special attention about the adoption of efficient management for poultry production.},

A strategy to estimate the energy efficiency level in this classification process is the use of building simulation.

	abstract = {The ever-increasing energy demand of the residential sector has required the adoption of tighter energy standards, aiming for high energy efficiency in dwellings. In Brazil, 24 million new residential buildings are planned to be delivered by 2022 through social housing programs, which could greatly impact on the country's energy consumption. In an attempt to minimize this impact, the Brazilian Labelling Scheme for Residential Buildings (RTQ-R label) was launched in 2010 as a voluntary standard for the evaluation of housing energy efficiency. The RTQ-R label focuses on building fabric and hot water systems performances, and generates a score based on the building's energy efficiency levels. The Passivhaus standard, developed in Germany, is one of the most stringent standards and is also the fastest growing energy performance standard in the world with more than 30,000 buildings certified to date. It also focuses on building fabric but establishes a maximum energy consumption target. In this work, the authors developed a comparative review of the RTQ-R label and the Passivhaus standard as means to inform a broader debate about building codes in the context of the current calls by governments for increased energy efficiency. The findings highlighted the different nature of the standards' requirements and targets adopted, and the benefits and constraints of both. © 2014 by the authors.},

In this paper, the limitations and the solar irradiation levels received by building surfaces in different positions (with azimuth and tilt angle variation) in capital cities in Brazil are shown, making use of the Brazilian global horizontal solar irradiation data provided by the SWERA (Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment) project. These data were processed to generate figures on the irradiation at various PV module orientations and slopes for each city, which show the relative radiation levels received on specific azimuth and tilt angles in relation to the ideal position. Results were validated using four real and operating PV systems. In general, variations in azimuth or slope did not cause large annual irradiation losses up to around 20° tilt angles. This shows to PV system planners that under these fairly flexible conditions it is possible to install PV on any orientation, keeping high levels of annual irradiation, and that limitations in orientation and tilt can be relatively low. It also allows a quick analysis of PV retrofit in building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV), when seeking the best building surfaces to incorporate PV. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In tropical countries, such as Brazil, daylight is an important feature used to reduce energy consumption in buildings. However its indiscriminate use may result in situations such as glare and excessive heating of the room. To prevent such unwanted situations and allow natural light in the room, shading devices appear as an important strategy. The Brazilian Regulation for Energy Efficiency of Residential Buildings (RTQ-R) considers shading devices by their effect on the thermal behavior of buildings, not taking into account the artificial lighting energy consumption caused by their presence. In order to study this issue, a thermo energetic behavior investigation was conducted for rooms with different shading devices. Simulations were performed in Daysim and EnergyPlus to get quantitative data about artificial lighting activation and the room´s energy consumption and thermal performance. This article shows the choosing process between the artificial lighting activation systems available in Daysim 3.1, to determine the best one to evaluate artificial lighting activation in residential rooms with shading devices. The studied systems are "switch off occupancy sensor" and "combination on/off occupancy and dimming system" which were named in this study "user-sensor" and "automatic-sensor", respectively. The automatic-sensor is controlled only by occupancy and illuminance sensors while the user-sensor is activated by the user. The results showed that, although the user-sensor demonstrates a situation closer to a real user, the automated-sensor allows a more accurate view of the need of artificial lighting activation. This was evidenced by the greater variance between the increase in energy consumption of rooms with shading devices, in comparison with the model without solar shading, for the automatic-sensor in regard to the user-sensor. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.},

This article describes the development of a new model that uses a method where openings are represented by single glass and double glass. The model is based on a healthy balance equations purely theoretical and empirical data. Simplified equations are derived through a synthesis of the measured data obtained from meteorological stations, as well as the literature. The implementation of the model in a design tool integrated naturally lit buildings is discussed in this article, to better punctuate the requirements of comfort and energy efficiency in architecture and engineering. Assumes significant importance in studies of heatstroke buildings, aiming to guide the professionals through the process of architectural design, preliminary study and detail of construction elements. It was used a method of degree-days for an assessment of the energy performance of a building showed that the design of the architectural design should always be considered the materials used and the size of the openings. The energy performance was obtained through the model, considering the location of the building in the city of Curitiba, Foz do Iguaçu, Londrina and CascavelPR. Obtained climatic data of these locations and in a second step, it was obtained the coefficient of total heat loss in the building pre-established so evaluating the thermal comfort and energy performance. It was observed that heating degree days in winter are of 77.78 to Curitiba the base temperature of 14 ° C and cooling degree days in winter 30.17. For Curitiba lower air exchange, the lower the energy consumption for heating and thus the higher the intake, the greater exchange of air. This means that the more openings in buildings in Curitiba, and are installed to the east side, they may be higher because the glass added to the geometry of architectural spaces will cause the environment conserve energy. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The red ceramic industry in Brazil, consisting of over 7000 companies, requires large amounts of thermal energy, currently being met mainly by native fuelwood, which causes serious deforestation and soil erosion problems. The use of firewood does not allow achieving good energy performance in industrial ceramic kilns, causing high energy losses, low productivity and low quality products (bricks and roof tiles). Thus, to implement higher added value products, besides mitigate environmental problems caused by deforestation, the use of natural gas by the sector seems to be a promising alternative. Brazil's natural gas market has grown at a fast pace in recent years. Its share in the country's primary energy consumption increased from 3.7% to 9.3% between 1998 and 2007, compared to almost 21% in the world. The development of the Brazilian natural gas industry was grounded on stepping up supplies through integration with Bolivia from where natural gas is imported, together with fiscal incentives for promoting the demand. This paper estimates that the natural gas market that could be developed in the Brazilian red ceramic industry corresponds to less than 5% of the total industrial natural gas consumption, meaning that a major technological transformation of the country's red ceramic industry will not severely affect the natural gas market equilibrium, contributing to reduce the country's high rates of deforestation. © 2008.},

	abstract = {The buildings envelopes have a great influence in determining the building performance, so the facades and roofs have function of control the environmental condition. Some of these are the entrance of noise and heat exchange of the buildings between the interior and exterior. One of the bioclimatic architecture challenges is to provide alternatives to integrate the building with the environmental parameters. The public schools constructions, in the northeast of Brazil, often are built using passives methods. This study aims to analyze the integration of the acoustic, thermal and efficient energy performance of school buildings envelopes in a tropical region of Brazil. The methodology was assessment the envelope of three different schools following the integration between the noise conditions in the classroom, checking compliance with requirements for facades and roofs, according to Brazilian standards of thermal and energy performance. The energy performance used was according to the Technical Regulation on Quality Level Energy Efficient in Commercial Buildings, and Public Service in Brazil. The results showed little integration among the acoustic, thermal and energy parameters. In conclusion, it was observed that the deployments of these factors, it makes school buildings to be guided to find solutions aiming at a more sustainable context.},

	abstract = {Many countries have turned their attention to the production and -consumption of biofuels over the last years. This interest is due to factors like the need to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, counteract surging and increasingly volatile oil prices, search for a more diverse energy matrix and the development of the agricultural sector. For developing countries, biofuels are also seen as an opportunity to reduce oil dependency, minimize foreign debt, improve living conditions in rural areas (including the access to basic energy services) and enhance economic activities. In particular, this is the case of many African countries. Despite the growing interest, large-scale biofuels production and consumption are concentrated to few countries/regions, such as the US and Brazil, in the case of ethanol, as well as European Union (EU), the US and Argentina, in the case of biodiesel. Due to the size of their potential markets, the US and EU will have a crucial impact on trade and may open for more export opportunities for producers in developing countries. However, currently both the US and EU have trade regimes based on tariffs that offset the comparative advantages of some producer countries. In addition, doubts have been raised regarding the real benefits of biofuels. Some criticize their efficiency in mitigating GHG emissions whilst others raise doubts about the pressures on food supply or the non-existence of socio-economic benefits for the population directly affected by biofuels production. Indeed, the effective sustainability of biofuels has been recognized as an essential aspect for their consolidation in the international markets and both in Europe and the US sustainability criteria have been defined. This chapter assesses the international trade of biofuels with particular focus on African countries, which have a reasonable potential for biofuels production, but may face difficulties in building up the required infrastructure and fulfil the sustainability criteria imposed by the main consumer markets. The main conclusion is that African engagement in an international trade of biofuels is far from being reality, even because so far the market is distorted by trade barriers. In addition, the conditions for large-scale production aiming at exporting are still precarious. On the other hand, in a hypothetical scenario of fair trade environment, the sustainable production of biofuels in Africa would be a unique opportunity for fostering economic and social development. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

	abstract = {In tropical countries, the greatest thermal gain occurs through the roof of a house. In Brazil, the use of an asbestos-cement roof without a ceiling is very common. Thus, there is intense heat transfer to the internal environment, which may cause thermal discomfort to the inhabitants. One way to reduce the heat flux is the use of radiant barriers, which reduce the heat flux through radiation. The use of this type of barrier in Brazil began in the mid-1990s and since then it has become popular for the thermal insulation of building roofs. However, there is a drawback regarding the experimental methods for the evaluation of the energy efficiency of these sheets. Many manufacturers show only the thermal conductivity, or give sparse information on the percentage reduction in radiated heat. There is currently no Brazilian normalization regarding the effective reductions in heat due to the use of these sheets. This study presents a compact apparatus for the determination of the efficiency of insulation sheets based on the use of heat flux transducers. Also, two models using thermal resistances which give simple correlations of great usefulness are presented. The sensitivity of the efficiency in relation to the several variables involved can be verified by exploring these correlations algebraically. Test results for different types of insulation sheets are reported and compared with the theoretical models. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

LCA is applied in compliance with the international standards of ISO 14040. System boundaries are defined following a "cradle to grave" approach, taking into account all the life-cycle phases including the raw materials supply, the production of the components of the plant, the operation and maintenance, and the end-of-life. The operation step of the assessed systems is simulated with TRNSYS models. Two reference buildings are modeled for two different sites, Palermo (Italy) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), according to local practices and regulations. The building models are normalized to have the same peak cooling demand (12 kW). The results show that the assessed energy and environmental performances of the grid-connected systems are usually better than the others for both climates, while the manufacturing process of storages in the stand-alone configurations does not allow these solutions to be competitive yet. Furthermore, the impact of the high average national electricity conversion efficiency in Brazil on the results is analyzed and discussed.},

In the Brazilian state of Pará, both human activities and natural impacts affect coastal resources and the local economy, which is based on tourism and fishing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of these two processes on the characteristics of a macrotidal beach (Ajuruteua) in northeastern Pará and provide local authorities with guidelines for the implementation of effective coastal management programs. Social and natural variables were assessed between April 2008, and September 2009. The Ajuruteua waterfront is characterized by the presence of precarious wooden structures built on mangroves, dunes and the intertidal zone, with limited infrastructure. Unregulated urban expansion, associated with natural conditions, is the main factor responsible for the erosive processes observed in the northwestern sector of the beach. River discharge and circulation processes are the main factors responsible for the high levels of water turbidity and dissolved nutrients observed in the study. Bacterial contamination is caused by the discharge of untreated domestic sewage, although the rapid turnover of the water in this high-energy environment dissipates the pollution rapidly. Priorities for local environment planning should include: (i) the prohibition of new buildings in risk areas; (ii) the improvement of recreational facilities and the provision of adequate services (public sanitation system and water supply); and (iii) the establishment of a permanent and appropriate water quality monitoring program.},

Although several countries produce oranges and juices, two regions in the world are the responsible for around 80% of the production. These are the states of Sao Paulo in Brazil and Florida in the USA. Although the emerging countries are growing in production, the juice consumer is also concentrated in the USA and Europe where more than 90% of consumption takes place. The characteristics of this chain are so unique, that it makes a nice laboratory for academics and business people to exercise strategies, since risk is spread. Orange is a very sensitive plant, and fluctuations in production are notorious. The logistics of this chain are fascinating. The product travels great distances to reach the consumer in a generally safe and efficient way. The industry assets such as vessels and tanks are specific. By reading this book, business people, academics and chain practitioners have an opportunity to understand this chain. and can analyse all of its numbers and economics and exercise strategy building. This is needed since the orange juice market is a stable market in the world, growing only 1% per year, and the production costs of this chain are rising fast, due to structural changes faced by world food and agribusiness companies i.e. labour costs, energy costs, land costs, environmental costs and others.

The assumptions of the project involved key aspects such as sustainability and eco-efficiency in design solutions and materials specification. This paper aims to develop an analysis of the studies for the development of the project in environments such as the Central Building and the laboratories of the expansion of Cenpes, focusing on the simulation of the designed environments regarding thermal comfort performance, using software such as Analysis CST and Analysis BIO. The article is structured in four parts: design features of the laboratories and Central Building, environmental comfort criteria adopted in their respective projects, simulation of thermal comfort in the study areas using the software Analysis CST and Analysis BIO and final considerations. This paper intends to provide subsidies to break paradigms that can lead to a new mark to the Brazilian construction industry by adopting rational systems, with reuse, use of natural energy resources and, when possible, reduction of the materials used. As a consequence, a construction that is cleaner, more efficient and has a lower operating cost emerges, due to the various eco-efficient assumptions adopted in the project stage contributing to the materialization of the expected thermal comfort during the preparation of the project. © 2012 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {The study on the thermal performance of the air-conditioned buildings of the new research centre of the Brazilian Petroleum Company, in the tropical climate of Rio de Janeiro, was part of a bigger research and consultancy project involving environmental issues. The architectural design was the subject of a national competition in 2004, encompassing over 100,000 m2. According to the design brief, out of the 10 buildings of the new research centre, 7 have to be either completely or partially air-conditioned, due to specific occupation requirements. The challenge for better thermal performance was related to systems' energy efficiency, to the introduction of natural ventilation and to the notion of adaptive comfort, which were verified with the support of thermal dynamic simulations. At the early stages of the assessments, the potential for natural ventilation in the working spaces considering the mixed-mode strategy achieved 30% of occupation hours. However, the development of the design project led to fully air-conditioned working spaces, due to users' references regarding the conventional culture of the office environment. Nevertheless, the overall architectural approach in accordance to the climatic conditions still showed a contribution to the buildings' energy efficiency. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to analyze an office building energy performance at Rio de Janeiro. Electrical power consumption profile of a building, resulting from a simulation using building energy-use simulation software, is obtained during a typical year and is shown on an hourly basis and pursuant to final uses. Thus, power consumption figures are obtained through the following final uses: lighting, office equipments, air conditioning and others. Analysis of this profile is accomplished by comparing existing technologies in the building, architectonical design solutions and building materials used, with the resulting power consumption figures evidenced during simulation. The consumption portion relative to air conditioning facilities is emphasized in this paper, since it's highly representative and offers a high potential of adequacy, from a viewpoint of equipment efficiency, and as a result of local thermal load factors. After simulations, comparing the present building model with incremental situations in thermal resistance, both on facades and top-level floor, it was noticed that energy performance of building undergoes a large influence from facade protection. Glass covered areas, even featuring glass with satisfactory thermal resistance, is quite encompassing and produces a large impact on building global power consumption figures. Based on this conclusion, an option was made to evaluate, in detail, impacts caused by different solutions to facade protection. Situations with varied hatching, change of glasses as well as glazed area were simulated and analyzed. Lastly, this paper evidences the need to evaluate, still in a project phase, of the impacts on power consumption figures, resulting from a building materials choice and architectonical design solutions, which can be applied in the building. Development of a culture which valuates energyefficiency and which involves agents of this area, is extremely important: creation of an adequate legislation and designer awareness in order to avoid applying architectonical enclosure typologies that are inadequate for our climate, are goals to be attained.},

	abstract = {Surrogate models are an important part of building energy labelling programs, but these models still present low accuracy, particularly in cooling-dominated climates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the accuracy of surrogate models for labelling purposes. An ANN was applied to model the building stock of a city in Brazil, based on the results of extensive simulations using the high-resolution building energy simulation program EnergyPlus. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out to evaluate the behaviour of the ANN model, and the variations in the best and worst performance for several typologies were analysed in relation to variations in the input parameters and building characteristics. The results obtained indicate that an ANN can represent the interaction between input and output data for a vast and diverse building stock. Sensitivity analysis showed that no single input parameter can be identified as the main factor responsible for the building energy performance. The uncertainty associated with several parameters plays a major role in assessing building energy performance, together with the facade area and the shell-to-floor ratio. The results of this study may have a profound impact as ANNs could be applied in the future to define regulations in many countries, with positive effects on optimizing the energy consumption. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study allows the analysis how sustainable issues have been treated before the establishment of this concept, helping us to reflect on the future from a historical perspective. Seven rooms in two houses were selected for in situ measurements and simulations. Indoor and outdoor air temperatures and relative humidity were measured with data loggers HT-500, during 91 days in three different months in 2011: June (low air temperatures and low relative humidity); September (high air temperatures and low relative humidity); and December (medium air temperatures and medium relative humidity). The measured dates are analysed allowing the comparison among different building comfort zones and also are used to calibrate the virtual model of the dynamic simulations. Three different building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus, Heliodon and Analysis Bio, are used to solve the energy balances and to evaluate possible limitations of the applied sustainable strategies in the cases. The main conclusion is that it is possible to identify, at the same time, technical limits of applied solutions that result in a thermal performance below his potential, and, a considerable reduction on the thermal demand of the modern naturally-ventilated houses.},

In Brazil, the simulation practice has begun by professionals in the construction industry, encouraged by Procel/Eletrobrás public agency, which aims to consolidate energy efficiency practices and was one of the promoters of the energy label for buildings launched in 2009. This paper discusses some of the modeling criteria required from the energy label regulation for a naturally ventilated educational building in Brazil. It also indicates some solutions not previewed in the regulation, as well as some simulation limitations of the adopted software, Energy Plus, and some valid simplification decisions which improved simulation speed. The building is composed of a complex spatial arrangement, with zones of different uses and different height and area. The analysis was performed in the perspective of the regulation comfort indicator: occupied hours of comfort in each zone and in the building, using ASHRAE 55 as the comfort criteria. Temperature gradients, neighborhood shading and zoning decisions are some of the discussed features. The model resulted in label B for the building, in a five level scale which A is the most efficient.},

The research methods included the estimation of daylighting potential from obtained daylight coefficients (DCs) for periods of the year and sky conditions, other than those of the onsite measurements; the evaluation of conformity of the lighting system to the Brazilian RTQ Code (Regulamento Técnico de Qualidade), an energy consumption rating system, aimed at reducing electric energy consumption in office buildings; the estimation of electric energy demand for a combined use of daylighting and lighting system; the proposal of an efficient lighting system; and cost assessment using payback analysis. Results suggest energy savings of up to 94 when integrating daylight with the artificial lighting system, a payback within the range of 22-60 months for a complete substitution of the existing lighting system for a more efficient one. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

The publication of national energy benchmarks is a fundamental step for understanding energy consumption in commercial buildings and developing energy efficiency programmes.

A methodology for benchmark development is proposed, using both statistical data and energy audit data to benchmark end-use energy consumption, with the use of wet-bulb cooling degree hours for climate correction. Benchmarks and climate corrections are developed for the energy consumption of bank branches in Brazil. A simple linear regression analysis of data from 1890 bank branches in 57 different climates provides the energy consumption benchmark, while thermal simulation of building performance is used to validate the results and provide an end-use breakdown in the different climates studied.

In order to provide architects with feedbacks about designing better products and recovering existing ones, especially concerning energy efficiency aspects, softwares assume a role of paramount importance in the quantification of impacts of parameters adopted during project development. As currently observed in Brazilian constructions, the substitution of traditional window frames by the "curtain walls" and the decreasing use of solar protection on façades have been affecting the environmental quality of those buildings. Therefore, this work evaluated the thermal and energetic performance of prototype office buildings created with the Design Builder software and located in the city of Brasilia, Brazil, in order to better understand what happens with real constructions, since the model was based on typical characteristics observed among over 200 existing office buildings in the city. The computer simulation considered the WWR (Window Wall Ratio) and the properties of glass variation in different façade orientations combined to two environmental conditioning situations. The simulations provided data that help to conclude that the larger the glazed areas in the façades, the higher the internal air temperature and how the simple fact of changing the glasses' properties or opting for less glazed portions of façades could provide better results in therms of internal air temperatures and energy consumption with air conditioning systems, representing commitment to the sustainability.},

	abstract = {According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is clear that the buildings sector presents the biggest potential for deep and fast CO2 emission reductions on a cost-effective basis. Interestingly, this assessment was premised exclusively on technical (engineering) measures, but ignored completely the behavioural and lifestyle dimensions of energy consumption in the buildings sector. Behavioural change in buildings, however, can deliver even faster and zero-cost improvements in energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (ghg) emission reductions. With this In mind, designers are beginning to shift their attention to how they can widen the range of opportunities available in a building to provide comfort for the occupants, both in new-build and retrofit contexts. This in turn has re-awakened an interest In the role of natural ventilation in the provision of comfort. This discussion about adaptive comfort raises several questions, including the following: How can we shift occupants' comfort expectations away from the static indoor climates of the past towards the more variable thermal regimes found in naturally ventilated buildings? Are building occupants 'addicted' to static environments, i.e. air-conditioning (AC)? If so, how tolerant or compliant will they be when the thermally constant conditions provided by AC are replaced by the thermally variable conditions that characterize naturally ventilated spaces? Does the frequency of prior exposure to AC bias building occupants' thermal expectations and, if so, what are the implications of this bias for their acceptance of naturally ventilated indoor climates? Does prior exposure to AC lead building occupants to actually prefer AC over natural ventilation? This article addresses these questions in the context of a large field study of building occupants in a hot and humid climate zone in Brazil (Maceio). The temperature preferences registered on 975 questionnaires in naturally ventilated buildings are statistically analysed in relation to occupants' prior exposure to AC in their workplaces.},

The author discusses about the idea of both modes of operation being used simultaneously or in parallel, and how this concept has been developed for one experimental building prototype in tropical areas of Brazil (Northeast region). Quantification is given through extensive parametric simulations which have been conducted using different environmental simulation programmes-TAS (EDSL, UK), ESP-r (ESRU, UK) and photovoltaic (PV)-Design PRO-G (Sandia Labs, USA). Thermal comfort levels along with energy use were assessed and compared, in terms of degree hours of overheating/under heating and cooling energy use. The prototype design has also taken into account the appropriate use of resources through sustainable design features: efficient use of energy, water and materials. The results have demonstrated that for regions such as the warm-humid tropics, the use of a mixed running strategy have optimized energy performance and provided better levels of thermal comfort in a much more effective way. For some cases, cooling energy savings up to 80% were feasible on a hybrid mode, where thermal comfort was improved up to 65%.

	abstract = {The concept of energy efficiency is addressed in a way that identifies the risks of policies based strictly on the assessment of the transformation of final energy into useful energy. Considerations of only the efficiency of technologies employed in the final uses may generate distortions in the identification of options that truly preserve natural resources and minimize environmental impacts, especially when different energy sources are used as primary inputs. Herein, the impact of different approaches is discussed through a case study on the regulations of energy efficiency for buildings. The selection of the approach is relevant, especially with regard to a comparative analysis between the use of electricity and other energy sources, such as fuel gases and/or renewable energy. The risks of policies that encourage energy efficiency anchored exclusively in simplified approaches are identified through the analysis of regulations in four countries: Brazil, China, India and Russia. In addition, this work estimates the change in average efficiency of the electricity generation sector for these countries over the period from 1980 to 2008, demonstrating that the assessment of primary energy consumption should guide the policies of energy efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Nowadays, it is very important that water and energy resources are used appropriately as this is a challenge to promote sustainable development. In some sectors, such as water and sewerage utilities, energy consumption depends on water consumption. The main objective of this work is to estimate the potential for electricity savings in a water and sewerage utility by reducing potable water consumption in the residential, commercial and public sectors in the city of Florianópolis, southern Brazil. These three sectors account for 98.9% of the total water consumption in the city. By using data related to energy consumption and costs that apply to the local water utility for water and sewage treatment, and also the potential for potable water savings over the three sectors, it is possible to estimate the potential for energy savings by reducing potable water consumption and sewage treatment. Potable water savings were estimated by using data available in the literature about water end-uses for different types of buildings located in Florianópolis. Three options were considered: installing dual-flush toilets, reusing greywater and using rainwater. The average potential for potable water savings were 30.0%, 53.4% and 60.3%, respectively, for the residential, commercial and public sectors. Thus, the average potable water savings amount to about 10,153,835 m3/year, and the electricity savings amount to 4.4 GW h/year, which would be enough to supply 1217 houses or flats in Florianópolis, with an average energy consumption of 300 kW h/month. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {With morphodynamic-numerical models the development of estuarine systems can be simulated for a period of several years. In areas exposed to high waves the effects from waves on the sediment dynamics can not be neglected. Especially if there are also currents acting on the sediments. In order to simulate these effects the hydrodynamic-morphodynamic-numerical-model TIMOR3 (TidalMorphodynamics) was coupled to the spectral wave model WWM (WindWaveModel). This coupling procedure enables calculations in both models on the same unstructured grid, which allows extremely efficient simulations. The coupled model is used in an estuarine system in southern Brazil. The outer navigation channel which leads to the port of Paranaguá requires frequent maintenance dredging to guarantee safe navigational depths. The long shore tidal and wave induced currents in the area in conjunction with near shore high wave energy conditions cause turbulences that lead to a sediment transport along the beach and to permanent sedimentations in the navigation channel This complex system is simulated with the coupled model. The results as water levels, flow velocities and grain size distribution match well with measured values, nevertheless additional adjustments can be done to achieve even better results. With the coupled model it is possible to optimize the dredging and dumping process and to investigate the efficiency of building measures in the area.},

This paper, based on literature, illustrates how new and emerging ICTs will be applied in developing countries to mitigate impacts of climate change. It highlights some smart applications, like the smart grid, mobile phone, ICT-enabled technologies for energy efficiency and management, ICT-enabled smart technologies for transportation, land use change and forestry emissions mitigation, smart motors for enhancing carbon footprint reduction in manufacturing and smart buildings technologies. Detailed review and analysis of emerging economies, notably China and Brazil, were used to identify and recommend appropriate ICT-enabled climate change mitigation technologies. It concludes that while ICTs with low carbon footprints are potentially capable of mitigating impacts of climate change, there are existing constraints that these countries must overcome, including capacity building and ICT-embedded carbon-offset project financing. It is recommended that collaboration among policymakers, academia, research and business be enhanced, and capacity building could go a long way towards the realisation of this. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

After this landmark event, the Brazilian Government has been promoting energy conservation initiatives including the Thermal Performance in Buildings-Brazilian Bioclimatic Zones and Building Guidelines for Low-Cost Houses (ABNT, NBR 15220-3, 2005) and the Federal Regulation for Voluntary Labelling of Energy Efficiency Levels in Commercial, Public and Service Buildings (Carlo and Lamberts, 2008). These new regulations summarize an immense effort in order to provide guidelines based on Brazil's climate requirements for designers with specific items related to lighting systems, HVAC and building's thermal envelope. Yet requirements for naturally ventilated indoor environments appear as an open category.

The results indicated the crucial role the BIPV systems play in the early stages of design, and that they therefore must be implemented in such stages, avoiding the building self shading, the addition of new elements and raise of costs. It was also concluded that the panels shape, size and efficiency are key factors .to set up the FV system and their choice will have significant impact in the architectural building central ideas. All sceneries were checked with different technology and pre-design projects what allowed us to consider this building as a "Zero Energy Building".},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to apply a multicriteria method to define windows for an office building conceived for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under a compromise between landscape view, daylight level on work plan and energy efficiency. The intent is to select one from six proposed window solutions differing in window size, type of glass and solar shading devices. Several methods are applied to assess the performances for each of these criteria. Simulations are performed to obtain the annual indoor daylight levels. The measurement of the sight angles is carried out to quantify the landscape view. The prescriptive method from the Brazilian building thermal regulation is applied to assess the energy efficiency of each solution. The obtained results of the monocriterion analysis indicate several criteria conflict. In order to identify the compromise solution, the ELECTRE III method is adopted by means of the CELECTRE software. The results of the multicriteria analysis indicate that all solutions with solar shading have a more satisfactory overall performance than those with solar control glazing and without shading devices. Due to the large dimensions of the studied floor, large size windows with solar shading devices achieve better overall compromise results. It is concluded that the multicriteria approach is a very effective method to consistently analyze the solutions proposed for a problem and to assist designers to minimize the conflicts between criteria. It allows performing an integrated approach, enabling a more conscious, accurate and responsible decision making. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on Brazilian government incentives initiated in 2001 with Law 10.295, which regulates the National Policy for Conservation and Rational Use of Energy, Brazil has begun to develop methodologies for evaluating the energy efficiency of buildings. In February 2009 the Brazilian Energy Labeling Schemes for Commercial, Public and Services Buildings (RTQ-C) was published followed by the Brazilian Energy Labeling Schemes for Residential Buildings (RTQ-R) in November 2010. This article presents the methodology adopted by RTQ-R, the primary focus of which is the evaluation of naturally ventilated buildings, bioclimatic strategies for encouraging natural ventilation and daylighting, and evaluation of the water heating system. It also presents a review of House Energy Rating Schemes and shows the difference between the Brazilian Scheme and those applied by other countries.

	abstract = {The pursuit of so-called "green jobs" - employment that contributes to protecting the environment and reducing humanity's carbon foot-print - will be a key economic driver of the 21st century. "Climate-proofing" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a "just transition." Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible.},

In Brazil, two certifications were proposed for the residential sector in 2010: An energy efficiency Brazilian Labeling Program and a sustainable Blue Dwelling Certification (BDC). The BDC developers intend to adopt the residential energy labeling as one of the evaluating criteria for energy efficiency and thermal comfort. However, such programs present distinct evaluation methods and parameters. This paper aims to evaluate the combination of the requirements of both certifications using a typical dwelling project of a multistorey residential building. This work was carried out through a survey for the selection of a typical case, an assessment of the certifications requirements using the typical dwelling. The evaluation provided an analysis of compatibility of the certifications requirements and it showed that the typical dwelling presented low energy efficiency levels. Also, it was observed that the energy labelling program is more restrictive, which reinforce its importance energy efficiency in the residential sector. It is expected that the research contributes to integrate the certifications into one public program.},

The results show some peculiarity of this system in the Amazon region. Values of irradiance, temperature, PV generation and load consumption were analyzed, as well as the energy balance obtained during the six-month assessment period of the system. The system was designed to provide 13 kWh per month, according to the Brazilian normative resolution for electric power supply using individual generation systems with intermittent sources. The experimental data showed an average inverter efficiency of approximately 73.4 %, much less than the 85% usually stated by the manufacturers, and which is used in the design of many of those systems in Brazil. This fact, associated with the losses on the DC side of the system, result in an insufficient electricity generation to supply the 433.3 Wh per day on the AC side of the system, necessary to ensure the 13 kWh per month. The results obtained with this system help understanding its operation in hot-humid regions, such as the Amazon Region, which has a great need for this kind of individual PV system. The results also show the importance of the inverter's power save mode, primarily for low demands.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose a set of lifecycle-based indicators to describe material eco-efficiency of buildings normalized per unit of gross floor area (GFA), and at verifying feasibility of their calculation for building materials and components, based upon four case studies. The paper also examines the effects that discrepancies between two carbon footprint accounting methods (embodied CO2 (ECO2) vs embodied CO2e) have on communication of environmental performance of selected materials. Design/methodology/approach – The lifecycle assessments (LCAs) were performed through LCA support platform SimaPro 7.3. Data for materials/components production cycle modeling were collected from primary and secondary data from national literature or adapted from Ecoinvent database. Embodied energy, ECO2, blue water footprint (bWF), non-renewable content and volatile organic compound emissions (VOCe) indicators were calculated from lifecycle inventory (LCI) outputs, while embodied CO2e was calculated using CML 2001 v.2.01 impact assessment method. Findings – Obtained results suggest that a core database comprised of 12 materials and components – cement, ceramic blocks, steel rebar, sawn timber planks, PVC tubes, plywood, PVC conduits, roof steel structure, roundwood, ceramic tiles, hydrated lime and adhesive mortar – provides a very reasonable description of a building’s embodied energy (99.63 percent), embodied CO2e (97.50 percent), bWF (96.26 percent), non-renewable content (97.53 percent) and VOCe (95.38 percent) profiles. Except for bWF of cement and concrete, substantial reductions in the metrics’ values captured environmental advantages of partially substituting ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs) for clinker Portland. Originality/value – The disclosure of embodied energy and carbon, as well as of other environmental performance data at whole-building level (per unit of GFA) pointed out in this paper, allows comparability and helps to establish performance goals and benchmarks and to guide policy decisions. Following a coordinated methodological outline, future works are expected to evolve to gradually constitute a LCI database that enables the use of the proposed metrics and of LCA as decision-making tools in the building sector. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study aims to define a Zero Energy Solar-House and analyses its contribution to global warming mitigation by reducing Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. This study identifies guidelines for a Solar-House project regarding electricity use, environmental conditioning, solar systems and equipment in order to obtain energy efficiency. Data to evaluate the Solar-House model are provided by Ekó House Project, which is a solar house prototype. The balance of GHG emissions reduction focus on electricity consumption, and to account avoided emissions this study considers solar photovoltaic (PV) generation instead of grid electricity, as well as energy efficiency measures harnessing the sun's energy on a passive way. This study goes through a comprehensive analysis of Brazilian electricity system, the use of electricity by the Residential Sector and GHG emissions associated. As a result, this study sets basic guidelines for a Zero Energy Solar-House and accounts the potential do avoid GHG emissions with this housing model. Benefits due to large-scale implementation of this model in Brazil are evaluated. To measure the impact of these solutions on a larger scale is taken as geographic boundary Southeastern Brazil - a region with high population density and need for importing energy from other regions of the country - where this study considers the adoption of energy efficiency measures and PV generation for a percentage of dwellings. Results show potential to avoid up to 0.9 Mt CO2 emissions each month. From an interrelated analysis of solar PV generation and energy efficiency assessments, this study concludes that the solar-house taken as a reference has a significant potential to reduce GHG emissions, contributing to Brazil's sustainable development and global warming mitigation. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.},

In 2012, like every 2 years, the competition will take place in Madrid in September. During the 17 days of the contest, the participating houses will be evaluated on different categories, including one of most important: energy efficiency. Among the 20 participants in this edition, for the first time, there is one Brazilian team with its own project called the "Ekó House". This project is based on different energy efficiency strategies such as: - Photovoltaic Panels - Solar collector -Double glazing - Thermal insulation of walls- Shadings devices - Cross Ventilation - Chimney effect. As the competition takes place in Madrid, these strategies consider the local weather conditions for September. In this context a question still remains, What would be the energy behaviour of this house in Brazil? Or, in other words, what can we learn and apply for the Brazilian case from the Solar Decathlon experience? The main purpose of this study is to show, as an initial exploration, the different energy behaviour of the building in the different Brazilian climatic zones compared with the Madrid results. This target is achieved by simulating the "Ekó House" on EnergyPlus. This energy balance is given by the difference between photovoltaic generation and the energy consumption of the house considering a residential use.},

It is recognized that the effects of such a regulation on improving the sustainability of the built environment in Brazil can only happen through building design decisions. Accordingly, this article describes the development of a distance learning course, mediated by virtual learning environment, aiming to disseminate the process of Building Labeling, based on RTQ prescriptive method. The course was created in an environment called Virtual Learning Environment in Architecture and Design (VLE-A). Contents are available through hyperbook, and are divided into seven teaching units and the course is expected to last for eight weeks. The virtual learning environment represents an important opportunity for additional training to students and professionals, reaching a large number of people and effectively promoting the knowledge dissemination about the guidelines for applying the energy efficiency regulation. Several classes are in progress and it is expected to contribute for the professionals updating and to ease the development of voluntary labeling of the energy efficiency level in commercial and public services buildings.},

	abstract = {In the beginning of mankind's architectural history the resulting form was basically distinguished by the style, the material to be found near the construction site and finally the laws of physics - as by try and error the constructive systems had been developed. Over the time, other components have been added; the form finding process of architecture has been changed especially by the advancing technology and the possibility to mathematically foresee the physical outcome. Today simulation is able to very realistically calculate building performances, such as the thermal behaviour. Among many other components, laws and legislative restrictions emerge to cope with the development of societies and their ever-growing need to organize their cities. Nowadays, modern law-making is trying to deal with one of the major concerns for the future of our species: the lack of resources to sustain the world population with its 7 billion people. The conservation of energy sources around the world is playing a major rule, as fossil resources are soon to be exhausted and atomic power generation is in the hand of only a little number of states. Further, the production of electrical energy via carbon or oil is named one of the main responsibilities for air pollution and climate change. In Brazil the concerns started in the 1980s, with the oil crisis, but have been carried on to become part of the legislation only in the 1990s. In February of 2010 a proposal to evaluate the energy efficiency of buildings called Label PROCEL has been published. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.},

Buildings are responsible for using a vast amount of energy. To implement actions to save energy in old buildings, it is necessary to measure its energy efficiency. It is difficult to analyze the consumption of energy because of a great amount of variables. Even if there are some fixed variables, the external environment affects strongly the energy use. This paper presents a study, which searches an index of specific consumption with the external temperature. The present work took as base a acclimatized artificial building analyzed through simulation in the Energyplus and compared with measured values. The results collated by means of mathematical modeling had been adjusted for the considered index.},

	abstract = {Land use planning (LUP) is central for managing issues related to climatic variation in urban environments. However, Master Plans (MPs) usually do not include climatic aspects, and few studies have addressed climate change at the urban scale, especially in developing countries. This paper proposes a framework with ten categories for assessment of climatic variation in urban LUP. Each category comprises attributes that describe a complex of relationships in influencing local temperature variations. They are analyzed for the case of the Master Plan of Porto Alegre (MPPA), the Southernmost metropolis of Brazil. It is concluded that the MPPA is strongly grounded in climate-related land and zoning coordination, but exhibits weaknesses in building, cartographical and social aspects considered synergistically relevant for tackling problems related to urban climate variation. Furthermore, the MPPA does not contain provisions related to monitoring of local climate and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and it is ineffective for improving energy efficiency. Specific MPPA failures stemming from these weaknesses include: an increase of 21.79% in the city's urbanized area from 1986 to 2011 to accommodate a similar increase in population, with significant horizontal sprawl; average temperature rise of 0.392. °C from 1991-2000 to 2001-2010, with statistically significant increases in temperature found since 1931; significant vehicle traffic increases, especially since 2007. From these findings, it is possible to conclude that the MPPA does not offer answers to all the imbalances related to land use, and therefore gives insufficient support to tackle the issue of rising temperatures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first analysis of their individual experiences, through semi-structured interviews, indicates that the integration of bioclimatic concepts into design is beyond the development or improvement of tools. First of all, it is fundamental that these concepts are part of the design philosophy of the professional, which is determinant on the application of research and innovation in architectural practice. Therefore, before the tools, the formal education can be a tool to promote the inclusion of these principles as part of their design philosophy, influencing the approach to design. It happened in the cases in which there was a commitment of the school to develop a technical knowledge basis in building physics into studio activities, highlighting the aesthetic character of environmental integration. This basis was consolidated in the contact with the building site construction, which also strengthened their ethical commitment regarding the quality of the built object. It has the potential to generate confidence in the consideration of these issues, also making it easier to get the right information from available resources and tools, via a critical understanding of the different issues. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The Brazilian Federal Government has been recently promoting energy-conservation initiatives, most notably the 'Thermal Performance in Buildings - Brazilian Bioclimatic Zones and Building Guidelines for Low-Cost Housing' and the 'Federal Regulation for Voluntary Labelling of Energy Efficiency Levels in Commercial, Public and Service Buildings'. These new regulations provide information for designers based on Brazil's climate requirements, with specific advice related to lighting systems, HVAC and the thermal envelope of buildings. Nevertheless, requirements for naturally ventilated indoor environments appear as an open category without clear criteria. To address this, the paper proposes guidelines for naturally ventilated environments in which specific thermal and air movement acceptability goals must be achieved. The guidelines are based on results from field experiments in non-residential naturally ventilated buildings in different climatic zones as well as drawing on other studies. The proposed guidelines consider occupants' adaptive potential as well as thermal and air movement acceptability. Combining thermal acceptability with air movement acceptability is a key design challenge. Permissible operative temperature ranges are based on the ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort standard, and minimum air velocity requirements within the occupied zone are specified. Considerations also included 'active' occupants and specific control over openings and fans. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {This study aims to analyze the benefits of applying a Zero Energy Building (ZEB) as an alternative to conventional buildings in isolated and environmental protected areas in Brazil as a hosting unit. A Zero Energy Solar-House (ZESH) is defined, considering its fabrication, assembly systems, use of natural resources and strategies for energy efficiency, leading to low environmental impact. A Brazilian scenery is described regarding energy feeding conditions in isolated areas, the occupation of protection areas, which are coveted by real estate market and touristic exploitation, and the consequent environmental impact. The ZESH harnesses sun's energy throughout a photovoltaic (PV) system for energy generation, solar collectors for water heating and passive environmental conditioning. Besides, it has local wastewater treatment and solid waste management systems, reducing the environmental impact arising from the occupants activities. To verify the ZESH model, this study takes the Ekó House Project, an efficient solar house prototype that meets the ZESH premises. This study results in accounting greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions reduction by the solar PV electricity generation instead of diesel generators. Results point out a potential to avoid up to 14.4 t of CO2/year for one ZESH unit. It is observed that the ZESH contributes to enable the occupation of these areas by local communities or touristic exploitation with responsibility, low resources consumption and reducing the environmental impact when compared to conventional buildings, allowing these areas to develop on a sustainable way and benefiting local communities. © Copyright: CEPT University, Center for Advanced Research in Building Science & Energy, Ahmedabad First Published 2014.All rights reserved.},

School buildings are not air-conditioned so that energy economy considerations are seldom taken into account. The design of public schools does not consider aspects of extreme importance in thermal comfort such as high temperatures in the classrooms in most of the year. Furthermore, appropriate illumination levels in the rooms and in the covered courtyards, possible glare conditions, direct sunshine incidence in the students are not considered. This work presents results of the evaluation of three public municipal schools in the city of Campinas, Brazil. The field research consisted of collecting the variables associated with the local thermal and luminous environment in periods covering distinct climatic seasons. Observations were done of design elements that affect the thermal and visual performance, such as orientation, opening areas, façades and external and/or internal shading devices. The methodology also included gathering of information among teachers and administrative staff of the schools about the environmental control of classrooms and the building as a whole. Data about monthly electrical energy consumption were collected. The analyses of the results lead to defining the ranges of the building constructive aspects related to the efficient energetic school consumption and the thermal and luminous comfort.},

There is a relatively well-known repertoire of technical solutions, which provide efficient and comfortable buildings. Contrastingly, cultural influences appear in a surprising diversity. As a result, a proper technical solution may be not sufficient for the acceptance of the design. This paper discusses non-technical barriers to the dissemination of passive and low energy architecture on the basis of a multiple-case study in the city of Curitiba, Brazil and surrounding regions. The polarity between the architect's convictions for passive and low energy architecture and the client idiosyncrasies are presented. Those may range from an interest for environmentally sound solutions to a prejudice against the unknown, which may be extreme in the case of commercial intolerance against buildings, which are not conventional.Causes of acceptance and refusal are systematized. Finally, a general conclusion on what can be learnt from the Curitiba case study is presented, as a contribution to the success of passive and low energy architecture.},

	abstract = {The ceramic tile industry has become an extremely competitive sector. The entry of new Asian and South American manufacturers into the market is shifting the leadership in production and exports from the traditional clusters of Europe to China, Turkey, and Brazil. In this uncertain environment, enterprises should raise the quality and cut costs by means of new products and processes. Ceramic tiles lightened by carving of a deep back relief could give rise to a generation of new, efficient products. These tiles could be manufactured with fewer raw materials than the traditional ones, which may lead to saving of weight and energy. Additionally, a lighter final product improves working conditions on the shopfloor and at the building site. Nevertheless, lightened tiles are structurally different from traditional ones, and so is their mechanical behavior. Because tiles are constructive elements, it is necessary to know their response under typical loads and assure fulfillment of the valid standards. This paper aims at evaluating the flexural strength (R) of lightened ceramic floorings using solid three-dimensional modelling and the finite-element method, establishing a new formula for the application of the international standard ISO 10545 "Ceramic Tiles." In order to achieve this objective, one reference model and 48 different relief versions were designed, which underwent a simplified computational simulation of the bending test. In accordance with the Rankine criterion, the maximal stresses of each version were calculated, as much as their distribution. Next, we correlated the results defining a new parameter called "normalized thickness," defined as the thickness that a carved tile should have to behave as a traditional flooring under flexion. This parameter allowed the adjustment of the international standard ISO 10545 to this kind of a product, facilitating their certification and therefore their real introduction in the market. Finally, thanks to the collaboration of the company Keros Cerámica S. A., it was verified that the methodology used was appropriate. © 2009 The American Ceramic Society.},

The simulations with DesignBuilder software compare the energy and thermal performance of both buildings, those results allow the identification of their positive and negative aspects, as well as making a co-relation with the students' sensations of comfort - obtained through PMV vote. The research indicates that it will be possible to improve eco-efficiency of existing and new buildings and campuses by retrofitting and upgrading it with regard to better indoor conditions that really correspond to climate conditions (hot and humid summers and cold and damp winters), using passive strategies for heating and cooling and at the same time to improve rational use of natural resources and to reduce the environmental impact. Probably, giving comfortable conditions to the users will increase energy consumption, but there is a potential reduction of lighting and equipments that could minimize this impact.},

Several authors highlight the need for a holistic and inclusive vision for the sustainability of buildings, covering a wide variety of sphere: economic, social, cultural, and environmental. In general, the sustainability issue is assessed only in the aspects of energy efficiency, emissions, water and natural resources. Few times the acoustic comfort of the user is joined to the concept of sustainability. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the Brazilian instruments of performance and sustainability, such as certification High Environmental Quality (AQUA) for residential buildings, and a standard to assess the performance of residential buildings up to five stories (NBR 15575:2008), in the acoustic domain. The Brazilian standard is divided into three main areas: safety, livability and sustainability. Certification AQUA encloses eco-construction, eco-management, comfort and health. As for acoustics, NBR 15575 is more complete than the certification AQUA. Although they present different terminology for classification and evaluation of residential buildings, there are overlaps about quantitative measurements. It can be concluded that in Brazil, sustainability has become intertwined with performance and acoustic comfort, which fills a gap in the residential market.},

With the declining costs of this technology, building-integrated and building-applied photovoltaics (BIPV and BAPV) can efficiently and cost-competitively assist in delivering electricity in urban environments. We have quantified the potential of BIPV and BAPV generators on existing single-family detached residential buildings in Florianopolis-Brazil (latitude 27°S, solar irradiation 1550 kWh/m 2/year), in supplying each house and a fraction of the local utility feeder's electricity demands. We have measured and compared the annual output performance of thin-film amorphous silicon, and traditional crystalline silicon solar PV technologies, and proposed solar PV kits to be installed on all of the existing 496 residential buildings roof tops in the mixed residential-commercial area studied. The typical single-family, detached home roof covers can easily accommodate the proposed PV kits, with 87% of these generators yielding at least 95% of the maximum theoretical generation output of an ideally oriented and tilted PV system. Low-pitched, existing roof covers in residential houses represent excellent areas for PV integration at low latitudes. Installing BIPV on all of the available roof areas can make each and every house a net energy-positive building. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sustainable building in Latin America extends beyond the use of renewable materials, energy efficiency and low impact construction. Additional components are fitness for use, durability and adaptability over time, quality of indoor and outdoor areas, use of local materials, and social and economic development including employment, poverty eradication, improvement of income distribution and promotion of regional production. This text discusses strategies and barriers for the implementation of sustainable building in the region based on four focal points: (1) long- and short-term balance between building quality expectations at low environmental impact and the need to satisfy basic needs for large proportions of the population (2) development of sustainable building regional parameters, which can be significantly different from those found in developed countries (3) difficulties posed by formal and informal construction to sustainable building implementation (4) introduction of sustainable building in professional education. The industrialized countries taking part in the first rounds of the Green Building Challenge process (GBC) have developed environmental policies and finalized construction-oriented research investment. This solid foundation facilitated and allowed for immediate work on environmental assessment of buildings. Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico are now part of the GBC. Although it is clear that they cannot replicate methods based on the success they had in other regions, GBC can be a valuable means of introducing concepts and raising awareness. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Buildings are created to provide adequate climate conditions for the activities performed by occupants. According to thermodynamics and heat transfer principles, the thermal inertia of indoor environments is directly proportional to the volume of that environment. Based on these principles codes of practice for thermal behaviour of buildings have been established in different countries allowing to reduce ceiling heights while influencing indoor air temperature and reducing the indoor environment thermal inertia. For hot weather locations, such as in tropical countries, during most of the year, the reduction of ceiling heights causes a small increase in indoor temperature of environments. In addition, studies both in laboratory and based on mathematical models show that the variation in temperature between the upper and lower layers of an internal environment can reach up to 4 °C. Another consideration to be observed is that internal environments must have openings for ventilation, a mechanism that helps to control air temperature and the human sensation of heat. Taking as example the Belo Horizonte Building Code, a town in southeast of Brazil, in Minas Gerais State, between 1940 and 2010, when the usual minimum ceiling height reduced 40 cm, there were no compensatory changes in the Building Code of Practice related to the ventilation openings or other heat-control mechanism. In the last decade, other standards and technical manuals on the subject emerged, with certification systems and energy efficiency rating similar to the Green Building, such those existing in several countries. Aiming to evaluate the ceiling height influence on the environments' internal temperature, for this study three full-scale models, of 8 m2 room area, and window area of the 1/6 floor area, according to the minimum standards established by the Belo Horizonte Building Code of Practice were constructed. They were built in of ceramic blocks structural masonry, varying the ceiling height in the range of 3.00 m, 2.80 m and 2.60 m allowed by technical regulations since 1940 up today. In each one, thermocouples were installed at different heights for monitoring the internal temperature without ventilation, collecting data from winter to summer. Preliminary results indicates that temperature increases of 1°C for each 20cm reduction As the temperature range of human comfort is small, these variations, however subtle, may cause thermal discomfort to users. © 2013 IAHS.},

The method is based on potable water savings, embodied energy, energy consumption for operation, and investment feasibility analysis; and it was applied to a school in the city of Florianópolis, southern Brazil. The strategies considered to save potable water were rainwater, greywater, water-efficient appliances, and their combinations. The embodied energy was estimated using indices of embodied energy per mass of material, and labour. The indicators used to rank the strategies were potential for potable water savings, index between potable water savings and embodied energy or total energy consumption, net present value, internal rate of return, discounted payback, and index between potable water savings and initial costs. All strategies and combinations were feasible, but the use of water-efficient appliances was the best. Amongst the indicators used to rank the strategies, five of them led to the same ranking. Such indicators can be applied to rank potable water saving strategies in other types of buildings and climates. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Thus, an energy efficiency study was carried out by monitoring a lot of animals, during a 94-day period. The energy rate of each compound involved in the production process was quantified and the matrixes of energy consumption were determined in the form of animal feeding, electrical energy, piglets, material used as deep bed, human labor, equipment, swine buildings, production of alive swine for slaughter, organic fertilizer production (swine deep bed or swine deep litter). From the direct input energy, 80.57% correspond to animal feeding, 11.90% to pigs for slaughter and 6.76% to piglets, while from the energy output 53.45% correspond to the terminating swine and 46.55% to organic fertilizer (swine deep bed). By the results obtained, we can conclude that such production system has corresponded to an industrial and highly specialized agro ecosystem, importing a great part of the energy consumed in the production process, with 41% of energy efficiency.},

The program adopted for the daylighting simulation was Daysim, and for energy simulations EnergyPlus. As a result, an index that combines the percentage of the environment area presenting more than 50% of UDI with glazing and floor area was obtained. Tins index allowed the development of a labeling system that classifies the windows from A to E.

The results for the commercial buildings show that there is equivalence between levels A to C of the Brazilian regulation and the reference model from ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 90.1 - 2007, depending on the climate adopted. For residential buildings, the reference model from ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 90.1 - 2007 resulted in higher energy consumption than level C from the Brazilian regulation for all the climates analyzed.

	abstract = {Natural lighting is recognized as an important strategy for the design of buildings that use energy in an efficient and rational manner. Natural illumination in hot tropical climates is very attractive, because artificial lighting, besides reducing the use of artificial energy it also reduces the air conditioning load, because after all, all artificial light is dispersed in heat form into the ambient. However, for the evaluation or elaboration of projects that use light, data for external illumination are necessary. Unfortunately, in Brazil and particularly in the Northeast of Brazil, these observations are still rarer than daily global solar radiation data. In this context, one station was installed in 2003, in Recife, Pernambuco and another in Pesqueira in 2004, for carrying out simultaneous measurements of daily solar irradiation and daily illumination and thus for determining the luminous efficacy factors. Another two stations are being installed on the Island of Fernando de Noronha and Xingó-SE, completing a group of four stations that are found between latitudes 8 and 10° S and longitudes 34 to 38° W.},

	abstract = {We studied selective logging near the town of Tailândia, along Pará Highway 150 in eastern Amazonia. Of the 48 sawmills present in the environs of Tailândia in 1989, 70% had been established since 1985, when Pará Highway 150 was asphalted. These mills generally contained one band saw and produced 250-350 m3 of sawn wood per month. Wood-use efficiency was low; frequently, 3 m3 of bole were required to produce 1 m3 of sawn wood. The loggers who supply wood to mills have become the main catalysts for the building of secondary roads in the region: of 272 km of side-roads that we surveyed, two-thirds had been built by loggers, frequently in exchange for partial logging rights on the lands of ranchers and agricultural colonists. Most of the logging occurs on 50 ha lots occupied by colonists. In interviews with 59 colonist families, we found that 86% were involved, either actively or passively, in logging activities. Those passively involved (61% of all families) simply sold trees in their forest tracts from time to time, whereas the 'active colonists' (25%) participated in the logging process. Logging roads and landings are opened by hand, using machetes and chainsaws. Seventy minutes of human labor are expended for each cubic meter of wood prepared for extraction. The energy expenditure per cubic meter of wood prepared for extraction is approximately 3000 kcal; 90% of this energy is in the form of the fossil fuels required to operate chainsaws. Considerable damage occurs in the logging process. We determined that an average of 2.0 trees or 16 m3 ha-1 were harvested in three study areas, each approximately 16 ha in size. The number of trees of 10 cm or greater dbh (diameter at breast height) damaged in the logging process averaged 58 ha-1 or 29 trees per tree harvested. Expressed in terms of volume, 1.2 m3 of bole were damaged for each cubic meter of wood harvested. Most logging damage (55%) was concentrated in the canopy openings created in the felling process. These openings were good sites for forest regeneration, 15 months after logging had ceased, logging openings contained, on average, 63 seedlings of timber species (0.2 individuals m-2). © 1991.},

	abstract = {In this research, the influence of external colour on the dynamics of the heat flow through a flat solid roof, with variable thermal resistance, has been studied analytically. The chromatic effect on the density of heat flow through the roof has been analysed using periodic solutions of the heat conduction equation, by means of Fourier analysis. The simulation has been carried out over a period of 24h, for the summer design day of Campinas, in the State of Saõ Paulo, Brazil, and its composite climate. An almost linear relationship between heat flow amplitudes (Δqi) and the thickness of a concrete roof has been noticeable in the range from 5 to l4cm for a grey coloured exterior surface and a corresponding white one. Conversely, from 15 cm and more, this relationship starts flattening. It may be concluded that as the thermal resistance of the concrete roof increases (> 15 cm), the effect of the exterior colour surface on the periodic heat transfer through the roof is attenuated. As a consequence, the conflict between choosing colour for aesthetics and assuring energy efficiency of opaque building components in hot climates can be mitigated, if building designers make proper use of thermal inertia.

Its final draining has been a relevant environmental problem in several countries. In Brazil, due to the growth of the urban population and the requirements of environmental agencies, efficient ways for sludge disposal or effluent treatment have been investigated. Possible discarding solutions include incineration, peptization, energy production and addition to fertilizers. This work focuses on the use of sludge in the ceramic industry for the production of light ceramic blocks, since this residue is basically composed of organic substances which volatilize during high temperature sintering. Mixtures containing different contents residue and clayed materials were prepared. For each mixture, after processing, the physical and mechanical properties of the burned pieces were measured, with emphasis on water absorption and linear shrinkage tests carried out as a function of the sintering temperature. Gresification diagrams were plotted for the temperature range of 850 °C to 1150 °C The addition of the residue provided an increase in the porosity of the material. Light blocks were sintered and presented adequate mechanical resistance for application as building material.},

The sustainability concept we use takes into account cultural aspects and is based upon three fundamental criteria to be used simultaneously: social equality, ecological prudence and economic efficiency. We make four recommendations regarding the establishment of indicators: binding, inclusion, foresight and quality. We worked with the possibility to change the scale, from general to particular, from the city to the district or to the block, and back to the city .We also include an intra-urban indicator, as a social variable, composed by two thematic indexes: quality of living index and environmental quality index. These thematic indexes are composed by a set of six other complementary indicators (bioclimatic, energy, efficiency, mobility, accessibility and segregation) which, associated to other variables, can express themselves in quality and quantity.},

In cases where there is integration, the potential for energy savings to be made on lighting is not always assessed. This paper presents a methodology to predict the potential for energy savings on lighting using an Ideal Window Area concept when there is effective daylight integration with the artificial lighting system. The methodology was developed by using rooms of ten different dimensions and five different room ratios. The energy analysis work was performed using the VisualDOE programme for the climatic conditions of Leeds, in the UK, and Florianópolis, in Brazil. Following this, the potential for lighting energy savings was assessed for each room using a method based on Daylight Factors. It was observed that the potential for energy savings on lighting in Leeds ranged from 10.8% to 44.0% over all room sizes and room ratios for an external illuminance of 5000 lux; and in Florianópolis, the potential ranged between 20.6% and 86.2% for an external illuminance of 10000 lux.

This paper presents results of a study measuring the effects that evaporation provokes on the internal surface temperature of ceramic tiles and fibrocement tiles. Its objective was to investigate in test bed, the internal surface temperature reduction of ceramic tiles and fibrocement tiles, using water spray at São Carlos (Brazil) climate conditions. Tests were shared in two phases. In the first part, from May to August 2004, a test bed with artificial heat source was used, protected of wind effects and solar radiation, however submitted at ambient temperature and humidity variations. In the second phase showed in this paper, the test bed was exposed to wind actions, having the Sun as heat source, carried on from December 2004 to February 2005. Two identical tiles were investigated simultaneously. The first one was kept dry (without water spray). Water was sprayed on the second's external surface, with intervals of ten minutes. Climatic conditions were verified by checking ambient temperature and psychrometric differences. Correlation analyses were done between: the checked surface temperature differences and estimated differences - function of psychrometric differences and wet tiles surface temperatures in °C. Using regression method, strong correlations were found among the falls observed in the internal surface temperatures of the tiles and the climatic conditions. In the first part of experiment, the evaporation provoked reduction of up to 36 °C in the ceramic roof and up to 12 °C in the fibrocement one. The second part of tests - using the Sun as heat font - internal temperature reduction results in ceramic tiles case was of up to 18,6 °C. In fibrocement tiles case, the temperature reductions were of up to 16,90 °C.},

	abstract = {Brazil has gone through an important electricity generation crisis in 2001, but the country does not have as yet a legislation to improve building energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of Brazilian buildings can well be improved, as it was shown during the energy rationing period in 2001. This efficiency increase could usher in gains in quality for indoor environments, as well as lower investments in power generation facilities, including the emission of gases into the atmosphere, flooding arable land for reservoirs, etc. The current work briefly demonstrates the lack of planning that caused the electricity crisis, some results of multi-building studies and simulations of an existing office building of Rio de Janeiro. In this parametric case-study, we have simulated variations of the window-wall ratio (WWR) with different glasses and interior shade, using the natural light, aspects deemed to be of the utmost importance for a future Brazilian building energy efficiency legislation.

	abstract = {Conical and double disc refiners were originally designed and intended to shorten and fibrillate long cotton and softwood fibres for papermaking. In 1997, Piläo introduced a new style medium angle, triple-cone, conical refiner. The Piläo conical refiner was originally developed to improve the refining homogeneity and decrease the high no-load energy requirements associated with the Jordan and Claflin refiners. Building upon their double disc refiner base design, they created a conical refiner with a floating double faced rotor. This enabled the use of a tackle with an increased edge length and shallower channels. The new rotating assembly decreased the no-load energy requirement and the new tackle reduced the intensity and improved the refining (when compared to previous conical refiners). This refiner gained widespread use in more than 200 installations around the world. The prototype unit was installed in 1997 in a Westvaco recycled linerboard mill in Valinhos, Brazil. The trial results from this installation also showed that the new style conical refiner have improved fibre development and energy efficiency when compared to past conical and double disc refiners. Subsequent trials and installations on various types of fibres have duplicated these results. The new triple cone refiner performed very well in developing short/recycled and long fibres while retaining fibre length and strength. This paper will present the concept of the triple-cone refiner, and the data from a Pinus trial installation. A discussion on the characteristics of disc and conical refiners will follow including a summary.},

The Jylhavaara conical refiner was originally developed to improve the refining homogeneity and decrease the high no-load energy requirements associated with the conical and disc refiners. Building upon their double disc refiner base design, they created a conical refiner with a cantilevered removable rotor. This enabled the use of a cast tackle with an increased edge length and shallower channels. The new rotating assembly decreased the no-load energy requirement and the new tackle reduced the intensity and improved the refining (when compared to previous conical refiners). This refiner gained widespread use in Europe. However, the refiner was not successful with hardwood and other short fiber pulps as the intensity could not be reduced to the level required for good development without fiber shortening. In 1997, Westvaco installed a new, triple-cone, double-flow conical refiner at their recycled linerboard mill in Valinhos Brazil. The trial results from this installation also showed that the new style conical refiners have improved fiber development and energy efficiency when compared to past conical and double disk refiners.

	abstract = {The solar radiation received at the surface of the earth, apart from its relevance to several daily human activities, plays an important role in the growth and development of plants. The aim of the current work was to develop and gauge an estimation model for the evaluation of the global solar radiation flux density as a function of the solar energy potential at soil surface. Radiometric data were collected at Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil (latitude 25°13' S, longitude 50°03' W, altitude 880 m). Estimated values of solar energy potential obtained as a function of only one measurement taken at solar noon time were confronted with those measured by a Robitzsch bimetalic actinograph, for days that presented insolation ratios higher than 0.85. This data set was submitted to a simple linear regression analysis, having been obtained a good adjustment between observed and calculated values. For the estimation of the coefficients a and b of Angström’s equation, the method based on the solar energy potential at soil surface was used for the site under study. The methodology was efficient to assess the coefficients, aiming at the determination of the global solar radiation flux density, whith quickness and simplicity, having also found out that the criterium for the estimation of the solar energy potential is equivalent to that of the classical methodology of Angström. Knowledge of the available solar energy potential and global solar radiation flux density is of great importance for the estimation of the maximum atmospheric evaporative demand, of water consumption by irrigated crops, and also for building solar engineering equipment, such as driers, heaters, solar ovens, refrigerators, etc. © 2002, Scientia Agricola.

Most of the discussion, however, is being carried out in developed countries with temperate climate, where sunlight is desirable most of the year. In Brazilian cities, where climate is mostly tropical, solar radiation availability is highly increased and overheating becomes a major problem. This paper describes the development of a tool that would evaluate solar access, using as a study case the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil (23°37'S, 46°39'W). The method, however, could be applied to any other location to which proper data is available. A procedure was formulated - using an anisotropic sky model, climatic data and geometry information - in order to calculate daylight availability and solar heat gain reduction. It predicts the impact of a building on energy consumption of neighbour sites for lighting, heating and cooling, and allows planners to verify impact of growing densities (and consequent higher obstruction angles) in urban energy performance.},

	abstract = {Passive techniques as an alternative to artificial cooling can bring important energy, environmental, financial, operational and qualitative benefits. However, regions such as the wet tropics can reach high levels of thermal stress in which passive means alone are unable to provide appropriate thermal comfort standards for some parts of the year. Despite a great accumulation of empirical information on the passive performance of houses for either free-running or conditioned modes, very little work has been done on the thermal performance of buildings that can operate with a mixed-running strategy in warm-humid climates. Buildings with such design features are able to balance the needs for comfort, privacy, and energy efficiency during different periods of the year. As free-running and conditioned modes are believed by many to be 'opposite' approaches, and have been presented as separate strategies, this paper demonstrates that not all parameters are directly opposite and a possible dual-mode integrated operation can be used for warm-humid locations for maximum comfort and minimum energy requirements. For this purpose, simulation runs using ESP-R (University of Strathclyde, ESRU, UK) were based on the climate data of Darwin (Australia) and on the ventilation styles of the house: free running and conditioned. Design features applicable to both, i.e. for a dual mode operation could be identified and the differences between conditioned and free running were demonstrated and proved not to be totally conflicting and therefore suitable for a dual mode operation. Different daily usage profiles (five use patterns were defined), and zoning of sleeping and living areas are presented. The dual mode use patterns compared to the base case house, for all the user possibilities, had improved performances of 17-52%, when compared to the free-running mode and 66-98% when compared to the conditioned mode. Simulation runs using other warm-humid climates (Miami, USA; Sao Luis, Brazil; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) were also conducted and compared to the results found for Darwin. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {In 2004 the Brazilian Petroleum Company, Petrobras, organised a national design competition for its new research centre, CENPES II. The architectural complex of over 100.000m 2 is planned to be built in 2006/07, by the Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The competition brief asked for an "environmentally friendly" solution, where issues of daylight, natural ventilation and energy generation were mandatory. The winning scheme was inspired by the integration between the "carioca" architecture (local from Rio) and the advents of contemporary technology. Following principles of environmental design, the local hot-humid climate had major influence in the architectural proposal. Since the conceptual stage, the design process was informed by intermediate environmental assessments, which were developed through a series of analytical studies using a group of advanced simulation tools. With special regards to the thermal and energy performance, the assessment came across the mixed-mode strategy, showing the potential of up to 30% of natural ventilation in working environments in the hot-humid climate of Rio de Janeiro. Highlighting the key qualitative and some specific quantitative outcomes, this paper summarises the winning scheme, from Zanettini Arquitetura S.A., co-authored by Arch. José Wagner Garcia and a team of consultants, including the Environment and Energy Group of FAU-USP.},

	abstract = {For many reasons building simulation programs are still not recognised as useful design support tools to the same extent as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or cost-estimating software. There is a strong perception that simulations are time consuming, costly, slow and require expensive or specialised equipment and knowledge that increase design costs. Additionally, simplifications applied to model description, algorithm inaccuracy, or deviations inherent to weather data treatment methods result in poor matches between measurements and predictions, which decrease confidence in obtained results. Finally, complex tools and interfaces raise doubts among potential users. In general terms, energy efficiency is a recent concern in Brazil, but has clearly come to the discussion forefront among all construction sector stakeholders. In architectural design teaching at the undergraduate level in Brazil, environmental comfort and energy efficiency have been traditionally kept as separate knowledge domains. To overcome these problems a new discipline has been introduced at the University of Campinas, UNICAMP in Brazil following a bioclimatic design studio, to consolidate the acquired knowledge and test concepts on student's designs. To evaluate this course an experimental follow-up research is currently underway. This paper discusses the contextual framework that motivated and founded the approach for the introduction of simulation as both a decision support tool and a design teaching resource. The bioclimatic design studio given in 2005 provided students a contact with simulation tools and was used to assess the suitability of the chosen tool for such experience.},
